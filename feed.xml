During a call with a community of data curators yesterday, I was asked whether ScholarSphere supported <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOIs</a> for citing data sets.</p>

<p>I have to admit that while I understand the value of data citation — tracking use &amp; re-use, measuring impact of data sets independent of their publications, giving credit to data publishers, &amp;c. — I continually get stuck on how identifiers such as DOIs from <a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> or <a href="https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/ARK">ARKs</a> from <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/ezid/">EZID</a> fit into the picture. Or, rather, why such indirect identifiers are valued more than the native HTTP URIs that are minted and managed by data repositories. Here I assume that these data repositories are run by institutions whose missions &amp; business interests include a commitment to persistence of content and identifiers held within their repositories. (Is that a faulty or naïve assumption?)</p>

<p>The argument for indirect identifiers — identifiers that point at and resolve to other identifiers — like DOIs usually goes like this: hey there, cultural heritage organizations and publishers have done a pretty poor job of persisting their identifiers so far, partly because they didn’t grok the commitment they were undertaking, or because they weren’t deliberate about crafting sustainable URIs from the outset, or because they selected software with brittle URIs, or because they fell flat on some area of sustainability planning (financial, technical, or otherwise), and so because you can’t trust these organizations or their software with your identifiers, you should use this other infrastructure for minting and managing quote persistent unquote identifiers.</p>

<p><strong>SIDEBAR</strong>: That’s a lot of becauses, all of which (to be perfectly frank) are painfully true. As an employee of a service provider within a very large academic library, I find this unacceptable. The solution from my perspective is not to punt responsibility for persistent identifiers. The solution is to confront each of those becauses and learn from our mistakes, and (as information service providers who oughta know better) to better steward and manage identifiers for data sets (and other deposits). I digress.</p>

<p>Are there other compelling arguments for using indirect identifiers to cite data sets? This is where you come in.</p>

<p>Back to the main point. Here is the million-dollar question about using (e.g.) DOIs for data sets: who manages these DOIs? Is it the service provider (such as DataCite, or <a href="http://scholarsphere.psu.edu/">Penn State ScholarSphere</a>)? Or is it the owner of the data set?</p>

<p>If it’s the service provider, how are they to know when data owners move their content elsewhere? And how does that scale?</p>

<p>If it’s the data owner, uh, really? Do we realistically expect data owners to manage their own DOIs? I may be being cynical here, but I somehow don’t see that happening on any scale that has an appreciable impact on the broader issue of data citability and identifier persistence.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/images/2021_mjgiarlo.jpg&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mike Giarlo is a coder for libraries&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Seattle, WA, US&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Email&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-at&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;mailto:michael.giarlo@rutgers.edu&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://twitter.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mastodon&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-mastodon&quot;, &quot;rel&quot;=&gt;&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer me&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://code4lib.social/@mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Cohost&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-microblog&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://cohost.org/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Keybase&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-keybase&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://keybase.io/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;ORCiD&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-orcid&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-6108&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Instagram&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-instagram&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.instagram.com/mjgiarlo/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-facebook&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}]}</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data citation is a topic that frequently comes up in conversations around data management.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Create a namespace, or namespaces, for identifiers that far exceeds foreseeable needs</strong> – Our first namespace can accommodate 7,072,810,000 identifiers.  We’re using the <a href="https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/ARK">Archival Resource Key specification</a> for identifiers (each of which will be mapped to HTTP URIs), and the Python-based <a href="http://github.com/mjgiarlo/arkpy">arkpy</a> library for minting.</li>
  <li><strong>Decouple the ingest process from the publication process</strong> – We plan to build a small suite of applications and tools upon our curation services platform, the first of which is for what we’ve been unimaginatively calling “generic ingest &amp; management.”  The application is for authenticated, authorized users only – it’s a tool for curatorial operations not for end-user display.  The ingest application will never automatically publish objects and it makes the assumption that all objects are private to the curator until the curator decides otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan for scale and test performance from the outset</strong> – The current phase of development on CAPS was given a very ambitious deadline so we have not had the time to focus on performance and scale as much as we would have liked.  We have a list of areas to address in the next phase, however, and a laundry list of technologies to vet and test for our scaling needs.  We’ve also lined up a small team of folks to help out with system testing &amp; QA.</li>
  <li><strong>Make metadata input optional</strong> – We believe that curators, not systems, curate, and thus allow them to decide how richly objects ought to be described.  We intend to provide curators with tools that allow (and perhaps encourage) rich metadata to be attached to objects but as far as the “generic” ingest application (and the curation services platform underneath) is concerned, all elements in the data dictionary are repeatable and none are required.  We will be building similar “profiled” ingest applications for specific purposes in the near future, such as an ingest application for electronic business records, which will, however, be more stringent about metadata (and also about file formats, which the generic ingest app couldn’t care less about).</li>
  <li><strong>Allow stakeholders to drive decisions and, above all, communicate with users</strong> – This may be a meta-lesson, and it feels like the most important of them all.  Our development team for CAPS consists of our lead developer, a digital curator, an archivist, a metadata librarian, a project manager, and an architect.  Our project team is made up of our development team plus stakeholders from across the University Libraries including representation from our Digitization &amp; Preservation department, the Arts &amp; Architecture library, and University Archives.  Our project team meets for one hour a week – a Herculean task to find a mutually convenient slot, let me tell you – and our development team meets for fifteen minutes every morning.  The point here is that our stakeholders – the primary eventual users of the ingest application – are invested in the project, and they get a chance to see, criticize, and drive what we’ve developed every week as it evolves. Because we’re in the same room so often, we get to communicate certain points regularly, e.g., what you ingest is only as permanent as you wish; identifiers are not precious at all; the curation platform is there for you to use in ways useful to you, so the typical “don’t put that into the repo yet” mindset doesn’t apply; your stuff is as findable as the richness of your metadata, but we can provide other ways to find your stuff (full-text search, etc.); and so forth.</li>

<p>A group gathered to discuss digital forensics, specifically in the context of forensics work done pre-ingest.  I’ve heard other folks talk about pre-ingest processes and so I wondered aloud: what does it say about our repositories, and the ingest process, that we do so much pre-ingest?  The consensus was that the ingest process is frequently expensive.  A subgroup split off to explore this.</p>

<p>The ingest process is a topic I’m keenly interested in since we (Penn State’s <a href="http://stewardship.psu.edu/">digital stewardship program</a>) are in the middle of building a prototype ingest application (“<a href="http://github.com/DanCoughlin/caps">CAPS</a>”).  If we can learn some lessons from our peers about how to make ingest easier and faster, the timing is right to build on these lessons and make novel, more interesting mistakes rather than boring, well-known ones.</p>

<p>Here are the barriers to ingest that were identified:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identifiers are precious</strong> – Ingesting an object usually kicks off a series of processes, one of which mints a new identifier for an object.  There is a perception that identifiers are a limited commodity, that they are somehow precious or rare.</li>
  <li><strong>Promise of permanence</strong> – There is a perception that ingesting an object creates a contract for the permanence of that object.  The contract may be illusory depending on the “repository” into which the object was ingested.</li>
  <li><strong>Findability</strong> – Once an object is ingested, it is difficult to find.  I would have liked to pursue this point a bit further.  What it suggests to me is that in some contexts, the repository has not been sufficiently incorporated into the workflows or work environments of those doing the ingest, so it feels like alien territory rather than the local filesystems and mapped drives they are accustomed to.  Pure speculation on my part.</li>
  <li><strong>Complex downstream workflows</strong> – Given that ingest is a series of processes, there is concern that “just ingesting something” might cause breakage downstream.  For instance, if an object is ingested, is it automatically published somewhere end-users can get to it, and has the object been fully prepared for publication?  One such workflow might be automatic generation of derivatives, which is an expensive operation for certain formats and large files.</li>
  <li><strong>Rights</strong> – Related to the above bullet, there is concern that end-user access rights be cleared in advance to ingest, for fear that the object will wind up in the wrong hands.</li>
  <li><strong>Metadata</strong> – The ingest process requires too much metadata input.  This concern is tied to findability above, and together they suggest an all-too-familiar tension: how much metadata is enough to make an object findable later, and how much is enough to make the ingest process cumbersome?</li>
  <li><strong>Psychological factors</strong> – There is a mindset wherein curation happens outside of the repository and preservation happens inside – that these are distinctly different activities which happen serially if at all – in which case one might be loath to ingest an object until it’s “ready” for the repository, whatever that means.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal time</strong> – The ingester simply lacks the time to push the right buttons.</li>
  <li><strong>Software performance</strong> – The ingest process is slow due to lack of optimization, lack of attention to scale, lack of performance tuning, and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of lessons to be learned from the above.  I’ll write soon about those and how we’re applying them to our CAPS project at Penn State.</p>

<p>Have any barriers to add to the list?</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/images/2021_mjgiarlo.jpg&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mike Giarlo is a coder for libraries&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Seattle, WA, US&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Email&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-at&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;mailto:michael.giarlo@rutgers.edu&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://twitter.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mastodon&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-mastodon&quot;, &quot;rel&quot;=&gt;&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer me&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://code4lib.social/@mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Cohost&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-microblog&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://cohost.org/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Keybase&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-keybase&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://keybase.io/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;ORCiD&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-orcid&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-6108&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Instagram&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-instagram&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.instagram.com/mjgiarlo/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-facebook&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}]}</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week I attended the latest iteration of one of my favorite conferences, Code4Lib 2011, which included a full-day CURATEcamp hackfest as a pre-conference session (sponsored by the Digital Library Federation).  Rather than writing up a full report of the event – no one really reads those, right? – I wanted to comment on a conversation from the hackfest.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Impressions from Open Repositories 2010</title><link href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/28/impressions-from-open-repositories-2010/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Impressions from Open Repositories 2010" /><published>2010-07-28T06:34:51-07:00</published><updated>2010-07-28T06:34:51-07:00</updated><id>https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/28/impressions-from-open-repositories-2010</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/28/impressions-from-open-repositories-2010/"><![CDATA[<p>One minor concern I brought to the <a href="http://or2010.fecyt.es/publico/Home/index.aspx">conference</a>, which has roots in my attendance at the 2007 conference, was whether it would be too system-oriented to be relevant, since Penn State doesn’t plan to use Fedora, DSpace, or ePrints.  I was pleased to see the increased attention to alternative approaches to preservation and to repositories as a set of services rather than (necessarily) as a system.</p>

<p>Penn State’s institutional digital stewardship program is investigating <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/curation/">curation microservices</a>, such as those developed by the University of California Curation Center, as an architecture for digital curation. So I came to OR2010 with an eye towards development in this space.  I wasn’t the only one; both the <a href="http://sun-pasig.ning.com/">PASIG</a> session and the <a href="http://duraspace.org/">DuraSpace</a> strategic overview identified microservices as a trend, and a number of microservices seem likely to be built into the 1.7 release of DSpace.</p>

<p>I attended the curation microservices BOF, which was well-attended taking into account it was up against a <a href="http://or2010.fecyt.es/Publico/Developer/index.aspx">developer challenge event</a> – institutions represented include Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Harvard, U. of Hull, California Digital Library, MIT, UNC-Chapel Hill, San Diego Supercomputer Center, Penn State, Northwestern, U. of Pennsylvania, and Princeton.</p>

<p>We discussed our interests in the topic, experiences w/ the microservices approach, development of a community around microservices, the California Digital Library’s role in sustaining said community, and governance of collaborative software development and of the community.</p>

<p>The BOF covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, and we agreed to start having periodic open teleconferences to share information about microservices development.  We’ll also utilize the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation">digital-curation Google Group</a> for virtual communication, and use events such as Open Repositories, <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/conferences/6th-international-digital-curation-conference">IDCC</a>, and <a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dp/ipres2010/">iPRES</a> – in addition to <a href="http://curatecamp.org/">Curation Technology Camp (CURATEcamp) events</a> – for microservices get-togethers.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/images/2021_mjgiarlo.jpg&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mike Giarlo is a coder for libraries&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Seattle, WA, US&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Email&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-at&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;mailto:michael.giarlo@rutgers.edu&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://twitter.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mastodon&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-mastodon&quot;, &quot;rel&quot;=&gt;&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer me&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://code4lib.social/@mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Cohost&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-microblog&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://cohost.org/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Keybase&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-keybase&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://keybase.io/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;ORCiD&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-orcid&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-6108&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Instagram&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-instagram&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.instagram.com/mjgiarlo/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-facebook&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}]}</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[One minor concern I brought to the conference, which has roots in my attendance at the 2007 conference, was whether it would be too system-oriented to be relevant, since Penn State doesn’t plan to use Fedora, DSpace, or ePrints.  I was pleased to see the increased attention to alternative approaches to preservation and to repositories as a set of services rather than (necessarily) as a system.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Braindump for Q3 2010</title><link href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/02/braindump-for-q3-2010/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Braindump for Q3 2010" /><published>2010-07-02T10:54:51-07:00</published><updated>2010-07-02T10:54:51-07:00</updated><id>https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/02/braindump-for-q3-2010</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/07/02/braindump-for-q3-2010/"><![CDATA[<ul>

<p>An <em>ad hoc</em> planning team – consisting of folks from Penn State, the California Digital Library, the University of California-San Diego, and the Library of Congress – has been hard at work bringing this idea to life.  On June 15th, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/msg/be42ea348491ff6b">we</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/status/16244857753">announced</a> on that registration for the event opened.  Eight days later, we <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/status/16875193143">announced</a> that all seventy-five slots had been filled.  Fret not, though; you can still be added to a <a href="http://curatecamp2010.eventbrite.com/">waitlist</a>.</p>

<p>The camp is now yours, digital curation community – let’s see what you’ve got.</p>

<p>CURATEcamp 2010 is but one of many events within our community.  I’d like to highlight some others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delphine Khanna (UPenn) and Stephen Abrams (CDL) have planned a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/msg/2a6f6464bea38ea7">microservices BOF session</a> at <a href="http://or2010.fecyt.es/publico/Home/index.aspx">Open Repositories 2010</a>.  It will focus on discussion of community around curation microservices.</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/pjvangarderen">Peter Van Garderen</a> has <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/msg/e40d43baa13c5cdd">proposed</a> a microservices BOF at <a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dp/ipres2010/">iPRES 2010</a>.</li>
  <li>Delphine Khanna has <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/msg/cf2b36dd10d51f3f">proposed</a> a pre- or post-conference session on curation microservices for the <a href="http://www.diglib.org/forums.htm">DLF Fall Forum</a> this November.</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/pmhswe">Patricia Hswe</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/declan">Declan Fleming</a>, and I have had a workshop proposal <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/msg/3bfd70ea2812bce5">accepted</a> for <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/conferences/6th-international-digital-curation-conference">IDCC10</a>, and the provisional name for this workshop, a full-day unconference, is CURATEcamp II.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whereas CURATEcamp 2010 focuses on the curation microservices approach, CURATEcamp II is a bit more general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: As the community of digital curation practitioners has grown, so has the need for collaboration and community.  A small number of communities have been formed around digital curation, a few of which focus on the technical aspects of the practice.  Extant communities address the implementation and support needs of specific curation platforms, without broader focus on common services and potential points of intersection. There is however a rich ecosystem of tools, practices, and standards around these platforms, and some that require no such platforms, that have potential to benefit the wider community of practitioners. CURATEcamp II is an unconference-style workshop for practitioners of digital curation to share best practices and discuss tools and technologies in a free-form and highly interactive forum.  Topics of interest might include identifiers, versioning, transfer, packaging, object structure, filesystem usage, archiving / storage, metadata standards / vocabularies, discovery, and interoperability. The unconference format ensures that all participants are actively engaged in the workshop and gives everyone an opportunity to contribute.  Activities may include roundtable discussions, presentations, whiteboard sessions, collaborative software development, and whatever else emerges from the collective creativity of participants.</p>

  <p><strong>AIMS</strong>: CURATEcamp II is an opportunity to build a community of practice around curation tools, that bridges system-specific gaps that have formed in the community. It will encourage discussion about curation tools and practices across software-, project-, and institution-specific boundaries, and attempt to identify best practices and points of collaboration across these boundaries.  The community that CURATEcamp II nurtures is intended to persist beyond the end of the IDCC, so another point of discussion will be around how to maintain connections between face-to-face gatherings. The informal approach of CURATEcamp II might also serve as a way to model knowledge sharing for the curator community, not unlike what occurs at BarCamp events, which are loosely structured but highly productive participatory sessions.</p>

  <p><strong>AUDIENCE</strong>: CURATEcamp II will be of interest to digital curation practitioners (curators and technologists alike), especially those who have been using and building tools and architectures, and digital curators with experience assessing or evaluating curation tools and services.</p>

<p>This is an exciting time to be working in the digital curation community!  Wondering how to get involved?  Hop on over to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation">digital-curation Google group</a> and join the discussion; it’s just getting started.</p>

<p>P.S.

A lot has changed since then<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  I continue to work on I2 however; they won’t get rid of me that easily.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2009/09/15/i2-survey-results/">last post</a>, I wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The next step is to build upon the report to draw yet more conclusions from the data â€” there’s an awful lot there â€” and flesh out some repository use cases for institutional identifiers. The I2 core group is moving quickly towards finalizing identifier metadata elements so that a standard may be drafted, and I think having some use cases documented will help drive the standard in a direction the community can get behind.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Since that time, the three scenario groups – Electronic Resources; Institutional Repositories and Learning Management Systems; and Library Resource Management – have concluded their work.  The work of the scenario groups included surveys of over 300 people working in these fields.  The survey results have been analyzed and reports were posted on the NISO website.  These reports have been used to flesh out use cases for an institutional identifier.  Upon completion of this work, the scenario groups were disbanded and work continued in a broader I2 working group.</p>

<p>The I2 working group has concentrated its work on analysis of similar standards and, as I alluded to earlier, significant effort has gone into defining core metadata to identify institutions, such as institution name, institution type, location information, variant identifiers, domain name(s), URL(s), and (optionally-typed) relationships to other institutions.  During these discussions it was difficult for me to hear the issues and needs around I2’s metadata and identifiers without <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2009/06/13/i2-strawman/">linked data springing to mind</a>.</p>

<p>While we are designing a standard and not a system or a service <em>per se</em>, it seems useful to include in the standard an informative section about implementation and architecture<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>; I find that reading standards is much easier on the brain when you get not only the standard itself but some examples of implementation, and that will be true as well, one hopes, of I2 standard implementers.  To that end, the group will be producing an XML schema of the I2 metadata elements and also an RDF schema.</p>

<p>I have been working on the RDF for I2 on and off for the past month or two.  Below are my impressions, as someone who is new to modeling in RDF, and the procedures I used to produce the draft RDF schema.
<!--more-->
Despite their names, RDF schema and XML schema are quite different<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.  The XML schema is a tool for validating an XML-based document or record, and it’s a common tool for modeling metadata in libraryland.  Not so with RDF schema, where the notion of document or record is replaced by the notion of a set of triples.  The focus in RDF is on the triple not on the document, and so validation of documents or records is not the point of RDF schema.  This took some effort to wrap my mind around.</p>

<p>Before I modeled I2 in RDF, I sketched out a domain model of I2 by copying relevant bits of information from I2 documents and pasting them into a text editor.  Then I put them into classes.  In I2’s case, the domain model contained three classes of things: metadata elements about an institution, relationships between institutions, and types of institution.</p>

<p>I gathered some examples of relatively simple RDF schemas and transformed them into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle</a> serialization format<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> for ease of reading, using them as a template for the I2 schema.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF schema (RDFS)</a> specification, there are two classes of things in the domain model: classes and properties.  If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, chances are you already grok this way of modeling, but otherwise, generally: a class is like a type and a property is an attribute.  If I were to model myself in RDF schema, then, I might say I am in the class of human beings, and one of my many properties is having a particular birth date, and another is having been born in a particular city.  The next step was to take the I2 domain model (metadata elements about an institution, relationships between institutions, and types of institution) and decide whether each thing was a class or a property.  I decided that the former two were sets of properties and that type of institution could be modeled as a set of classes.</p>

<p>Having a conceptual model of I2 and how it fit into the RDF schema way of thinking about things, I wrote a simple ontology defining one RDFS class per type of institution, and one RDFS property per metadata element and one per relationship type.  This would have sufficed as an ontology.</p>

<p>Exposing RDF-based resources on the web as linked data, however, represents an opportunity for metadata element-level interoperability at global scale.  In order to interoperate with the existing corpus of linked data available on the web, I went through the new I2 ontology and looked for areas where I could re-use, or subclass or otherwise link to, classes and properties already defined in more widely-used ontologies.  I realized at this point just how different coming up with a new XML document format was from writing an RDF ontology; whereas I might have wanted the former to be comprehensive and inclusive of every single aspect within the I2 domain model, my goal with the latter became to eliminate it (by trimming it down to only those bits which are not defined elsewhere).</p>

<p>Since the RDF ontology for I2 is not inclusive of the entire domain model, it seemed necessary to produce another reference document: a set of instances of I2 resources showing the mingling of new I2-specific classes and properties with well-defined classes and properties from other ontologies.</p>

<p>I shared rough first drafts of these documents and received very helpful feedback from some folks who are better-versed in this than myself.  I’ve now incorporated their feedback into the latest I2 ontology and instance document.  I hope to include both of these into a draft of the I2 specification which will go out for comment in the coming months.  Here’s the latest <a href="http://gist.github.com/358857">ontology</a> and the latest <a href="http://gist.github.com/358858">set of instances</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/01/e-content-stewardship-program-kick-off/">Reviewing digital library platforms</a> for the e-Content Stewardship Council</strong></p>

    <p>The platform review project that our digital collections curator and I have undertaken continues.  We began the project by having folks demonstrate each platform and how they use it, and have been busy with small, informal interview sessions with many of the same folks but also others who work outside of the Libraries.  We have a few more interview sessions to conduct and document, so the data gathering portion of the project is nearly complete.  In the meantime we’ve been discussing evaluation criteria.  We started off with a short list of criteria, but then noticed the criteria Purdue are using for their <a href="http://blogs.lib.purdue.edu/rep/">comparative analysis of institutional repository software</a> and adopted those instead.  We sketched out a structure for the final report, which we hope to finish in May.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reviewing functional requirements for an institution-wide repository of electronic records</strong></p>

    <p>This work is still under way.  We have a set of well-documented functional requirements for an e-records repository service but have yet to make progress on building anything.  We’ve been talking about applying for a grant to help fund some additional staffing which might be used to help build out proof-of-concept curation services (preservation, provenance, description, discovery) for e-records.  I’m really keen on applying <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/curation/">curation micro-services</a>, such as those used at <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">CDL</a>, to the e-records domain.  I see this effort as benefiting both the curation micro-services community and the e-records community – not to mention our own electronic records initiatives here at Penn state.  An all-around win, if you ask me, but then I’m biased.  This will be a major activity in the latter half of this year continuing into the next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Learning more about “<a href="http://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/promise-peril-big-data">big data</a>” and continuing the <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/01/data-management-discussion/">data management discussion</a></strong></p>

    <p>Our content stewardship program will doubtless need to address research data.  We’re not there yet.  In the meantime, Penn State’s ITANA chapter will be pulling together a working group on the technological and architectural challenges of research data.  <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/nucci/">Jeff Nucciarone</a> and I will be chairing the group.  In the meantime, research data has been on my mind for two reasons: <a href="http://www.lesk.com/mlesk/">Michael Lesk</a> gave a <a href="http://ist.psu.edu/newsevents/?pageID=736&amp;HeadlineID=2028">talk</a> at the information school urging libraries to turn their attention to research data; and I’ll be attending the <a href="http://www.asis.org/Conferences/IA10/ResearchDataAccessSummit2010.html">Research Data Access and Preservation Summit</a> in Phoenix later this week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evaluating the <a href="http://dlt.its.psu.edu/">DLT</a> <a href="https://lib.stanford.edu/files/PSU_Archival_Storage_Prototype_Final_Report_External%20v5.pdf">archival storage prototype</a> and joining the technical team of the Data Storage Working Group</strong></p>

    <p>The Data Storage Working Group effort has been repurposed.  The steering team will continue to meet informally and discuss archival storage and curation needs across the campuses.  The technical team has been dissolved, and the majority of us (who already work together in DLT in support of the same mission) will continue to work in this space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evaluating next-generation information discovery tools for the libraries with the Libraries’ Department of Information Technology</strong></p>

    <p>The RFP process continues.  We hope to have wrapped up our evaluation by the beginning of summer.[</p>

    <p>](http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/itech.html)</p>
  </li>

    <p><strong>Evaluating change management solutions with a team from Penn State’s <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/kxm/blogs/LibertyRoad/2007/08/itana-itsitana-1.html">ITANA</a> group</strong></p>

    <p>I haven’t found much time to stay involved with this team, unfortunately, but their work continues apace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Working on requirements for a draft institutional identifier standard with the <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/i2">NISO I2</a> working group</strong></p>

    <p>The I2 working group is putting finishing touches on a draft standard and on core metadata required to identify institutions.  We hope to share this draft and put out a request for comments in the coming months.  I’ve been modeling the I2 domain in RDF both for more RDF experience and also with the hope that an eventual I2 core service will be exposed as <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">linked data</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attending <a href="http://code4lib.org/conference/2010">Code4Lib 2010</a></strong></p>

    <p>You can tell how good a code4lib conference is by how little you remember of it.  By that measure, this year’s conference was the best yet.  Some of the highlights for me: 1) Linked data, a pattern for exposing resources and metadata via the web, continues to be a hot topic among cutting-edge library developers. There was a focus this year on how to participate in the linked data web in practical and lowish-barrier ways.  The speed with which concepts move, at code4lib, from “novel, and interesting to a few” to “widely talked about and deployed” is dizzying; 2) Software development practices continue to mature in libraries.  We’re talking more and more about test-driven design and agile development.  While these methodologies are beneficial to developers themselves, I find this remarkable because it means the gap between coders and stakeholders is being bridged, and that means better and more usable software, and happier users; 3) Repositories are not typically a hot topic at code4lib, but there were a number of prepared talks, lightning talks, and breakout sessions on the topic.  Fedora tends to be the repository most often talked about, if only because it is the repository that requires the most hacking – and these are the people doing the hacking.  What I found interesting this year was the dissatisfaction with monolithic repository software packages, and the movement towards “homebrewed”, though standards-based, repository services, such as those being advocated by the California Digital Library.</p>

    <p><strong>Meetings, meetings, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sara013/4269735919/">meetings</a></strong></p>

    <p>The meetings, they continue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Continuing to absorb as many of the following as possible: strategic plans, project portfolios, process management documents, and various and sundry reports, wikis, and blogs</strong></p>

    <p>And this continues as well, though it’s hard to find time to contextualize when you’ve got actual tasks and deadlines.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here are some new and upcoming things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve written about my <a href="https://mike.giarlo.name/blog/2010/01/whats-in-a-title/">search for a practice-oriented curation technology/architecture community</a>, and I’m glad to say I’ve made some progress on finding said community.  I’ve been part of a conversation revolving loosely around the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation">digital-curation group</a> and that conversation has now turned to planning a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation/web/curation-technology-sig">curation technology workshop</a> which we’re called CURATEcamp (CURAtion TEchnology Camp).  I hope to have more details to share soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am attending <a href="http://or2010.fecyt.es/publico/Home/index.aspx">Open Repositories 2010</a> in Madrid this July.  I expect to learn about how folks are using repository systems such as Fedora, DSpace, and ePrints, but am more interested in all the other stuff happening on the periphery.  There has also been talk of a curation micro-services birds-of-a-feather session, which might serve as a good event to get potential CURATEcampers talking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ll be in Washington, DC in a few weeks working on a team to evaluate <a href="http://www.imls.gov/applicants/grants/NationalLeadership.shtm">IMLS National Leadership grant</a> applications.  This will be a new experience for me, and one to which I need to devote a significant chunk of time between now and then, so I’m excited.  It will be interesting to see what folks are doing outside of Penn State, and also to get an idea for what sorts of projects wind up getting funded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>I have some vague ideas for project charters but have yet to really flesh them out.  One involves some collaborative development on tools around curation microservices, to be used and evaluated by honest-to-goodness curators with honest-to-goodness data, and the other is about benchmarking some distributed filesystems.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Techies at Penn State need to talk more.  I want a BarCamp-style event for PSU techies so that we can discuss issues across departmental boundaries.  Administrators have been nothing but supportive of the idea, and now I just need to find some time to sketch what I have in mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Digital Library Technologies, my department, is hiring!  We’re looking for someone to come develop software to support our content stewardship program.  Like writing code?  Interested in how data is curated, stored, and discovered at scale?  Consider applying.  (Will link to position when it goes public later this week.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Braindump complete.  Brain now empty, except to say: boy, State College sure is lovely in the spring.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;avatar&quot;=&gt;&quot;/assets/images/2021_mjgiarlo.jpg&quot;, &quot;bio&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mike Giarlo is a coder for libraries&quot;, &quot;location&quot;=&gt;&quot;Seattle, WA, US&quot;, &quot;links&quot;=&gt;[{&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Email&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fas fa-fw fa-at&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;mailto:michael.giarlo@rutgers.edu&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Twitter&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-twitter-square&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://twitter.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Mastodon&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-mastodon&quot;, &quot;rel&quot;=&gt;&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer me&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://code4lib.social/@mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Cohost&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-microblog&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://cohost.org/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;GitHub&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-github&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://github.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Keybase&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-keybase&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://keybase.io/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;ORCiD&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-orcid&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-6108&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;LinkedIn&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-linkedin&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjgiarlo&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Instagram&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-instagram&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.instagram.com/mjgiarlo/&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;=&gt;&quot;Facebook&quot;, &quot;icon&quot;=&gt;&quot;fab fa-fw fa-facebook&quot;, &quot;url&quot;=&gt;&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mjgiarlo&quot;}]}</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My my, has it really been three months since I wrote up my agenda?  I’ve been busy chipping away at the agenda so I thought I’d document my progress now that Q2 is underway.]]></summary></entry></feed>
