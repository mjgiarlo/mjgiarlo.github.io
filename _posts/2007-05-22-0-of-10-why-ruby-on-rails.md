It would be an understatement to say I've been enthusiastic about Ruby on Rails for a while now.  Okay, I am downright fanatic -- just look at that shrine to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHH" target="_blank">DHH</a> in my closet; it's plain to see that I've drunk the (ruby red) Kool-Aid.

This is the first post in a series in which I hope to share my enthusiasm and explain just what it is that I love about Ruby on Rails.  Not many folks in the library world seem to be using RoR -- with a <a href="http://libraryfind.org/" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bibapp/" target="_blank">notable</a> <a href="http://umlaut.library.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">exceptions</a> -- and so I thought it might be of interest to folks unfamiliar with or curious about Ruby and Rails to hear some impressions from a bright-eyed newbie.

Stay tuned, folks.
