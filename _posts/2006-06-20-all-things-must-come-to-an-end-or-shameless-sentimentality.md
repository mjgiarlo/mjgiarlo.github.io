One such thing, a just recently ended venture, is my bachelorhood.  I've been away for much of the past couple weeks preparing for, celebrating, and recovering from Elizabeth's and my wedding on June 11th.

And because sometimes jabbering about library technology, and thinking about the many and challenging issues facing our profession, can just plum tucker a guy out, I'm posting tonight to share a photograph my beloved mother took of Elizabeth and myself on our 0th anniversary.  There'll be plenty of time in the future to spend on the aforementioned jabbering and thinking; for now, I'm just enjoying life.<!--more-->
