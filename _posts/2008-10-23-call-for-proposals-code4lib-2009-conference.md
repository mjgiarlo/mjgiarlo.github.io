Hear ye, hear ye, techie librarians and library techies:

Birkin James Diana, representing the host, Brown University, <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/code4lib@listserv.nd.edu/msg04087.html" target="_blank">announces</a> a call for proposals for talks at the code4lib 2009 conference:

<blockquote>The code4lib conference is wonderful in large part because of what you folk share.

Head over to the Call For Proposals page and submit your idea for a prepared talk. Information about the time-frame, scope, and evaluation process -- as well as the link to the submission form -- can be found at:

http://library.brown.edu/code4libcon09/proposals/

Some important notes:
- Proposals can be submitted through Sunday November 23 2008.
- Just like when you vote, use your code4lib username and password.
- You initially won't be able to edit your proposal(s), but I'll have that implemented in the near future.
</blockquote>

More information on prepared talks from the <a href="http://library.brown.edu/code4libcon09/proposals/info/" target="_blank">proposal page</a>:

<blockquote>
Prepared talks are 20 minutes, and must focus on one or more of the following areas:

    * "tools" (some cool new software, software library or integration platform)
    * "specs" (how to get the most out of some protocols, or proposals for new ones)
    * "challenges" (one or more big problems we should collectively address)

The community will vote on proposals using the criteria of:

    * usefulness
    * newness
    * geekiness
    * diversity of topics

We cannot accept every prepared talk proposal, but multiple lightning talk sessions should provide everyone who wishes to present with an opportunity to do so.</blockquote>

Do consider submitting a talk if any of that sounds interesting to you.
