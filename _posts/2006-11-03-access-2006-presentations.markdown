<a href="http://www.access2006.uottawa.ca/?page_id=10" target="_blank">Presentations from the Access 2006 conference</a> have been posted.Â  Slides and audio are provided for many of the talks.Â  Check them out if you were not able to make it this year.

My laptop's back like Lazarus thanks to the healing touch of HP customer service.Â  I hope to find some time soon to type up the rest of my notes from the conference, hopefully before Access 2007*Â rolls around.

* To be hosted in Victoria, BC,Â a most charming city in my favorite corner of the world.
