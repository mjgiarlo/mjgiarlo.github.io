I was pleased to see the note that Sandy Payette sent to the fedora-users mailing list earlier today, updating the community on the <a target="_blank" href="http://comm.nsdl.org/pipermail/fedora-users/2006-December/002330.html">Fedora 2.2 release date</a>.  Version 2.2 is going to include a bunch of features, some of which have been long-awaited and are quite, well, sexy.  Some of the highlights:
<ul>
	<li>Database support has been extended to include Postgres, which should make all the MySQL-haters happy</li>
	<li>Fedora may now be deployed via a .war file in an existing servlet container, such as Tomcat, rather than requiring its very own Tomcat server</li>
	<li>A Lucene- or Zebra-backed search service has been included, which is more robust than the previous search service that used the built-in Dublin Core-populated database</li>
</ul>
These are but a few of the enhancements, and I can't wait to put it through its paces when it's released on January 19th.

For a more complete set of feature enhancements, click on the link above to read Sandy's message.

Now if we can come together as a community and work on some more UIs, and get them used in some high-profile projects, many of the gripes against Fedora may be silenced.  It's still not a perfect product, but what is?   That it uses XML as a storage format and exposes its functions via web-services APIs and allows use of any metadata schema, in my humble opinion, puts it <strong>head and shoulders above</strong> many other library repository solutions.  And for that, it's at least worth consideration.
