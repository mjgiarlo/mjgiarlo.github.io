One minor concern I brought to the [conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://or2010.fecyt.es/publico/Home/index.aspx), which has roots in my attendance at the 2007 conference, was whether it would be too system-oriented to be relevant, since Penn State doesn't plan to use Fedora, DSpace, or ePrints.  I was pleased to see the increased attention to alternative approaches to preservation and to repositories as a set of services rather than (necessarily) as a system.

Penn State's institutional digital stewardship program is investigating [curation microservices](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/curation/), such as those developed by the University of California Curation Center, as an architecture for digital curation. So I came to OR2010 with an eye towards development in this space.  I wasn't the only one; both the [PASIG](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://sun-pasig.ning.com/) session and the [DuraSpace](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://duraspace.org/) strategic overview identified microservices as a trend, and a number of microservices seem likely to be built into the 1.7 release of DSpace.

I attended the curation microservices BOF, which was well-attended taking into account it was up against a [developer challenge event](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://or2010.fecyt.es/Publico/Developer/index.aspx) -- institutions represented include Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona, Harvard, U. of Hull, California Digital Library, MIT, UNC-Chapel Hill, San Diego Supercomputer Center, Penn State, Northwestern, U. of Pennsylvania, and Princeton.

We discussed our interests in the topic, experiences w/ the microservices approach, development of a community around microservices, the California Digital Library's role in sustaining said community, and governance of collaborative software development and of the community.

The BOF covered a lot of ground in a short period of time, and we agreed to start having periodic open teleconferences to share information about microservices development.  We'll also utilize the [digital-curation Google Group](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation) for virtual communication, and use events such as Open Repositories, [IDCC](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/conferences/6th-international-digital-curation-conference), and [iPRES](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/dp/ipres2010/) -- in addition to [Curation Technology Camp (CURATEcamp) events](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705200051/http://curatecamp.org/) -- for microservices get-togethers.
