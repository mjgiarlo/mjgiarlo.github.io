That I very nearly called this post "Southern comfort" reveals me as a long-time yankee from the urban northeast.Â  No, I suppose Arlington, Virginia isn't quite the south -- certainly not culturally -- but you can see why I'd say so if you consider that I once thought any place south of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_195_(New_Jersey)" title="Interstate 195 (New Jersey)" target="_blank">195</a> may as well have been Deliverance country.Â  Ah, the old provincialisms.Â   And to further deconstruct this ridiculous metaphor, my entire apartment is probably smaller than a veranda.

But, boy howdy, did I have a relaxing and refreshing day: sitting on the couch with the windows open, reviewing a chapter of a friend's upcoming book, while the wind rustled the blooming saucer magnolia right outside the windows.Â  It was a beautiful, sunny day, and the pair of mourning doves that have taken up residence on the neighbor's window sill were soaking up the rays, singing their "woo-woo-oo-oo-oo" song on occasion.

Almost any sort of writing is a real chore for me and yet every now and then I commit to writing or editing something or other.Â  I enjoy it but it does take the sort of concentration that I've found so difficult of late.Â Â  I do not regret agreeing to review the chapter in question (on DRM technologies, for the curious), and I feel somewhat validated in my decision after the elements all aligned today and made for a very pleasant time.Â  (I did not get as much done as I would have liked, but what else is new?Â  Time management remains a challenging task, especially when the television and the internets are so near. )

I'm beginning to ramble and I don't really have a point.Â  It was a good day -- an entire good weekend in fact -- and I felt it worth committing to bits.

... Hey, are those banjos I hear?
