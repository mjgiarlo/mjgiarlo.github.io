<a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/" target="_blank">Dorothea</a> left a <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/09/11/code4lib-2007-review/#comment-45629" target="_blank">comment</a> on a <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/09/11/code4lib-2007-review/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing the publication of a little <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/10.1108/07419050710823247" target="_blank">conference review</a> some colleagues and I splurted out.  In the announcement I lamented a bit about impact and she wisely suggested I consider depositing the review in a subject repository such as <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/" target="_blank">E-LIS</a>.  

We looked into our agreement with the publisher and it was actually quite permissive.  (Way to go, Emerald.)  And here's the <a href="http://eprints.rclis.org/archive/00011670/" target="_blank">review</a> in all its open access glory.

Thanks, Dorothea!
