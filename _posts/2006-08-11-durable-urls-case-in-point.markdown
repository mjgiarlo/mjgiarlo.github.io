The title makes this post sound rather more interesting than it is.

In light of <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2006/08/02/going-to-princeton-code4lib/" target="_blank">my recent announcement</a>, I figured I would make sure that the three of you who are reading this -- assuming my mother and wife are still following along -- have bookmarked the durable URLs.Â  (Durable, at least, to the extent that they will live on after my 9/20 resignation date at UW.)Â  The persistent URL for Technosophia is <a href="http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog">http://purl.org/net/leftwing/blog</a>.Â  The URL for Technosophia's feed is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia">http://feeds.feedburner.com/technosophia</a>.

I'll be moving Technosophia and my CV (which is of great and obviousÂ value to the internet tubes) to a new server in the coming weeks, hopefully with very little disruption (especially for those who've bookmarked the durable URLs).
