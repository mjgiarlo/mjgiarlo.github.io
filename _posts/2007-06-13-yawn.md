There is a series of blog posts that is now getting a lot of press in the biblioblogosphere.  I won't link to it.  I won't refer to it by name.  And I will not name its author.

Goodness, why give the author the satisfaction of a response?  It lends his or her points a certain credence that they would otherwise lack.  This, my friends, is little more than the sound <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2007/06/web-20-the-sleep-of-reason-part-i/"></a> of irrelevance.  It will pass in time.
