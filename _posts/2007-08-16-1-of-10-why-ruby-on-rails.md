<h2>1. Ruby</h2>

I gave a little talk on Ruby at today's <a href="http://meta.montclair.edu/tag.html" target="_blank">VALE-NJ Technology Awareness Group</a> meeting, and so I'm using my <a href="/presentations/ruby-zen/" target="_blank">slides</a> to finally kick off this vaporseries.<br /><br /><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/presentations/ruby-zen/Ruby-Zen.swf" width="600" height="400"><!--[if IE]><param name="movie" value="/presentations/ruby-zen/Ruby-Zen.swf" />< ![endif]--></object><small>[Slides are embedded as Flash here if you're reading in an aggregator.]</small>

It seemed to be taken pretty well, though it could easily have been dismissed as the fanboyish ravings of a neophyte Rubyist.  The folks from Rutgers were interested in having me come talk to their software architecture group, so it couldn't have gone too badly, I suppose.

I need to stop cramming so much into presentations.  Rambling about reflection and OO at a speed the Micro-Machines Guy would envy isn't the best way to share enthusiasm about Ruby.

The rest of the meeting was interesting: Ron Jantz, the Digital Library Architect at Rutgers, posed a number of challenging questions about trust, authenticity, and reliability in the digital realm; Terry Catapano, Special Collections Analyst at Columbia, exposed the lack of data model inherent in many current metadata schemas and suggested ontologies as a potential direction; and Jeffery Triggs, Applications Programmer at Rutgers, demonstrated the Java DjVu Viewer Applet for displaying DjVu-based images outside the DjVu browser plug-in.  Many good questions were asked, and new faces were in the crowd, so the future of TAG seems to be bright.

I'm hoping to follow up my Ruby talk with another on Rails.  That was my initial goal for today, but there was far too much to cover, knowing the audience was relatively new to both technologies.
