    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I can hardly believe it&#8217;s been eight months since I last wrote about the <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/projects/niso-i2/">NISO I2</a> project.  A lot has changed since then ((I&#8217;ve moved and <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/12/22/forking/">changed jobs</a>, in fact)).  I continue to work on I2 however; they won&#8217;t get rid of me that easily.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/09/15/i2-survey-results/">last post</a>, I wrote:<blockquote>The next step is to build upon the report to draw yet more conclusions from the data â€” there&#8217;s an awful lot there â€” and flesh out some repository use cases for institutional identifiers. The I2 core group is moving quickly towards finalizing identifier metadata elements so that a standard may be drafted, and I think having some use cases documented will help drive the standard in a direction the community can get behind.</blockquote> Since that time, the three scenario groups &#8211; Electronic Resources; Institutional Repositories and Learning Management Systems; and Library Resource Management &#8211; have concluded their work.  The work of the scenario groups included surveys of over 300 people working in these fields.  The survey results have been analyzed and reports were posted on the NISO website.  These reports have been used to flesh out use cases for an institutional identifier.  Upon completion of this work, the scenario groups were disbanded and work continued in a broader I2 working group.</p>

<p>The I2 working group has concentrated its work on analysis of similar standards and, as I alluded to earlier, significant effort has gone into defining core metadata to identify institutions, such as institution name, institution type, location information, variant identifiers, domain name(s), URL(s), and (optionally-typed) relationships to other institutions.  During these discussions it was difficult for me to hear the issues and needs around I2&#8217;s metadata and identifiers without <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/06/13/i2-strawman/">linked data springing to mind</a>.</p>

<p>While we are designing a standard and not a system or a service <em>per se</em>, it seems useful to include in the standard an informative section about implementation and architecture ((This practice seems more or less common in my (admittedly limited) experience, cf. <a href="http://unapi.info/specs/">the unAPI specification</a>.)); I find that reading standards is much easier on the brain when you get not only the standard itself but some examples of implementation, and that will be true as well, one hopes, of I2 standard implementers.  To that end, the group will be producing an XML schema of the I2 metadata elements and also an RDF schema.</p>

<p>I have been working on the RDF for I2 on and off for the past month or two.  Below are my impressions, as someone who is new to modeling in RDF, and the procedures I used to produce the draft RDF schema.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Despite their names, RDF schema and XML schema are quite different ((This reflection should come as little surprise since RDF and XML are different kinds of things: RDF is a data model and XML is a serialization format.)).  The XML schema is a tool for validating an XML-based document or record, and it&#8217;s a common tool for modeling metadata in libraryland.  Not so with RDF schema, where the notion of document or record is replaced by the notion of a set of triples.  The focus in RDF is on the triple not on the document, and so validation of documents or records is not the point of RDF schema.  This took some effort to wrap my mind around.</p>

<p>Before I modeled I2 in RDF, I sketched out a domain model of I2 by copying relevant bits of information from I2 documents and pasting them into a text editor.  Then I put them into classes.  In I2&#8217;s case, the domain model contained three classes of things: metadata elements about an institution, relationships between institutions, and types of institution.</p>

<p>I gathered some examples of relatively simple RDF schemas and transformed them into the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/turtle/">Turtle</a> serialization format ((Using <a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html">rapper</a>, a nifty little tool.)) for ease of reading, using them as a template for the I2 schema.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">RDF schema (RDFS)</a> specification, there are two classes of things in the domain model: classes and properties.  If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, chances are you already grok this way of modeling, but otherwise, generally: a class is like a type and a property is an attribute.  If I were to model myself in RDF schema, then, I might say I am in the class of human beings, and one of my many properties is having a particular birth date, and another is having been born in a particular city.  The next step was to take the I2 domain model (metadata elements about an institution, relationships between institutions, and types of institution) and decide whether each thing was a class or a property.  I decided that the former two were sets of properties and that type of institution could be modeled as a set of classes.</p>

<p>Having a conceptual model of I2 and how it fit into the RDF schema way of thinking about things, I wrote a simple ontology defining one RDFS class per type of institution, and one RDFS property per metadata element and one per relationship type.  This would have sufficed as an ontology.</p>

<p>Exposing RDF-based resources on the web as linked data, however, represents an opportunity for metadata element-level interoperability at global scale.  In order to interoperate with the existing corpus of linked data available on the web, I went through the new I2 ontology and looked for areas where I could re-use, or subclass or otherwise link to, classes and properties already defined in more widely-used ontologies.  I realized at this point just how different coming up with a new XML document format was from writing an RDF ontology; whereas I might have wanted the former to be comprehensive and inclusive of every single aspect within the I2 domain model, my goal with the latter became to eliminate it (by trimming it down to only those bits which are not defined elsewhere).</p>

<p>Since the RDF ontology for I2 is not inclusive of the entire domain model, it seemed necessary to produce another reference document: a set of instances of I2 resources showing the mingling of new I2-specific classes and properties with well-defined classes and properties from other ontologies.</p>

<p>I shared rough first drafts of these documents and received very helpful feedback from some folks who are better-versed in this than myself.  I&#8217;ve now incorporated their feedback into the latest I2 ontology and instance document.  I hope to include both of these into a draft of the I2 specification which will go out for comment in the coming months.  Here&#8217;s the latest <a href="http://gist.github.com/358857">ontology</a> and the latest <a href="http://gist.github.com/358858">set of instances</a>.</p>

    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/12/22/forking</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am not certain if this is a good idea or not, but I decided to set up a &#8220;work blog&#8221; as I set off on my <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/status/4738074594">new path as a digital library architect</a>.  The lines between this blog and that blog are fuzzy &#8211; most lines are, in my eyes &#8211; so bear with me.  I&#8217;ve never been a prolific writer &#8211; it&#8217;s always a chore, an activity I simultaneously want to do more of, and do better, and also struggle mightily with.  (It&#8217;s the public school education?  HAR HAR!)   But even so, the posts here may slow yet more.  Or maybe that will be true of the new blog.  We shall see.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found that microblogging has largely filled the blogging gap for me; I&#8217;m more comfortable, somehow, posting smaller, more easily digestible &#8220;thoughtlets&#8221; via <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo">Twitter</a>/<a href="http://identi.ca/mjgiarlo">identi.ca</a>/<a href="http://facebook.com/mjgiarlo">Facebook</a>.  Perhaps I&#8217;ve succumbed to attention deficit disorder, flitting from one tiny undeveloped idea to the next.  It&#8217;s probable but I digress.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested, you can follow along as I grapple with <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/mjg36/blogs/">questions about digital library architecture</a>.  Comments are most welcome, both here and there, as always.</p>

    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/09/27/exploring-curation-micro-services</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://lackoftalent.org/images/micro_repo_thumb.png" alt="thumbnail of micro-repo tree" style="float: left"/>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, the most exciting developments this year in  repositories and digital curation have come out of the California Digital Library.  It has been impossible <a href="http://conferences.library.gatech.edu/or/or09/paper/view/95">not</a> <a href="http://uccsc2009.ucdavis.edu/preso/UCCSC-2009-CDL-PODS-v05.ppt">to</a> <a href="http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/98">notice</a> <a href="https://meeting-reg.com/sunpasig/abstracts.php">their</a> <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/events/ndiipp_meetings/ndiipp09/docs/NDIIPP%20Partner%20Meeting%202009_Breakout%20Session%20Schedule.pdf">papers</a> <a href="http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/108/84">and</a> <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/iPres/confsched.html">presentations</a>.  Put simply, their idea is that digital curation is enabled by &#8220;micro-services&#8221; built upon well-known abstractions such as the filesystem.  The benefits are obvious: filesystem tools are ubiquitous and cross-platform, and there are strong market forces to ensure the filesystem persists.  The idea is radically simple and straightforward, though many questions remain about such a paradigm.  I&#8217;ll return to those later.</p>

<p>If you have not yet taken a look at CDL&#8217;s curation micro-service specifications, most of which may be printed on as few as one or two sheets of paper, see the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/">Digital Library Building Blocks</a>.</p>

<p>My co-workers in the LC Repository Development Center have been chatting about these specs on and off throughout the year.  After months of procrastinating, I finally read all of the specs on Thursday; it&#8217;s wonderful that you can do so in the course of one reading session, I might add.  Yesterday a bunch of us RDCers got together to chat (informally) about the specs: what they&#8217;re for, how they work, and how they interact with one another.  I learn by doing, by examples, so I combed through each of the specs in advance of our meeting and tried to <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/statuses/4371794936">construct</a> a minimal repository ((Perhaps it&#8217;s more in line with the specs to refer to this space as &#8220;a managed filesystem that drives repository and curation services,&#8221; given the CDL philosophy that preservation is not a place/repository.  But it&#8217;s easier to say &#8220;repository,&#8221; so there you go.)) based on micro-services.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here is a tree visualization of the final product, inevitable warts and all: <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/images/micro_repo.png"><img src="http://lackoftalent.org/images/micro_repo.png" alt="sample micro-services repo tree" /></a>  The services I used were <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/namaste/namastespec.html">Namaste</a>, <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/can/canspec.pdf">Content Access Node (CAN)</a>, <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/pairtree/pairtreespec.html">Pairtree</a>, <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/dflat/dflatspec.pdf">Dflat</a>, <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/redd/reddspec.html">Reverse Directory Deltas (ReDD)</a>, <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/inside/diglib/clop/clopspec.pdf">Class-based System for Managing Object Properties (CLOP)</a>, and <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/library/resources/tools/docs/bagitspec.pdf">BagIt</a> (co-developed by LC and CDL).</p>

<p>As I mentioned in our Friday meeting, recounting my experience exploring the specs: the bad thing is that I spent an hour building a repository with rudimentary tools such as mkdir, touch, cp, ln, and emacs; but the good thing is that I built a <em>repository</em> in <em>one hour</em> using <em>common, rudimentary tools</em>.  It&#8217;s a very compelling paradigm.  <a href="http://inkdroid.org/ehs">Ed</a>&#8217;s already built a <a href="http://github.com/edsu/dflat">tool</a> implementing some of Dflat, further demonstrating how lightweight these micro-services are.  (<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Ed notes that this code is a work in progress and is &#8220;barely functional.&#8221;)  (<strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: The dflat library has come a long way.  Check it out if you&#8217;re interested.  Also, I just committed a pretty basic Namaste library: <a href="http://github.com/mjgiarlo/namaste">http://github.com/mjgiarlo/namaste</a>.  Only took about an hour, which is a testament to the power of lightweight specs.)</p>

<p>I am certain this will be a running thread at work as the specifications evolve and our understanding of them grows.  Some questions and comments that occurred to me while exploring the micro-service specs and building the minimal repo:</p>

<ul>
    <li>CAN was a bit puzzling.  The spec is simple enough, but I found some of the conventions confusing, and I was left wondering what CAN provides other than a container.  What I would like to see is a simple use case and perhaps more examples.  Thus, the CAN stuff in my sample repo doesn&#8217;t feel very useful only because I had a hard time working with the spec.</li>
    <li>CLOP feels like the least mature of the specifications.  It seems generally useful to be able to put digital objects, however you define that, into classes and define properties on those classes.  The spec did not clearly convey to me just how it accomplishes that aim.  A few examples would go a very long way.  I&#8217;ve got some CLOP stuff in the sample repo but I have no idea how close my implementation matches the spec.</li>
    <li>Is Dflat dependent on ReDD?  One would assume not since there&#8217;s an optional property in the dflat-info.txt file for specifying a delta scheme.  But, say, could you stub out the v001 directory (reserved to hold the initial version of a digital object) and use a system such as <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> or <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">bazaar</a>?  <br/><br/>One might argue that these established delta schemes, if you want to call them that, have many more developers and users than a system such as ReDD and thus should persist longer and have more tools built around them.  I imagine the micro-service viewpoint would acknowledge that point, but counter that the spirit of these specs is to avoid dependencies from outside the filesystem?</li>
    <li>Is the ReDD specification meaningful outside of a Dflat given that any one ReDD directory knows nothing of its successors and predecessors, or is it dependent upon Dflat?</li>
    <li>Could a BagIt bag live inside of the ReDD reserved &#8220;full&#8221; directory?  That is, could the &#8220;full&#8221; directory be marked up appropriately to <em>be</em> a BagIt bag?</li>
    <li>How many tools exist for these specs?  I notice there&#8217;s code in CPAN for Pairtree and Namaste, which is a fabulous start.  Tools are the difference between YAMF (Yet Another Messy Filesystem) and reliably managed curation services.  Granted, tools such as cp and emacs already exist and are part of the appeal of these micro-services, but there&#8217;s also tremendous room for error if operations are all done &#8220;by hand.&#8221;</li>
    <li>To what extent has CDL transitioned to using these specs/tools?</li>
        <li>Are other institutions using these specs/tools?  I have heard tell that digital library folks from the University of Michigan and the University of North Texas may be involved.</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope I don&#8217;t sound overly critical.  I&#8217;m really glad our colleagues at the California Digital Library have written these specifications and applied their deep experience to what could be a transformative paradigm ((Please excuse the fanboyishness; this filesystem fetishism is exciting stuff!)) in the digital curation world.  Kudos to them!</p>

    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/09/26/command-line-shuffle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being a nerd, I tend to like the command-line.  When I&#8217;m working on my laptop at home, I tend to like listening to music.  Before I discovered that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer">mplayer</a> had a really convenient shuffle idiom, I would invoke it thusly (to listen to all my Pavement tracks in shuffle mode):</p>

<pre lang="bash">
export IFS=$'\n'
for track in $(find /mnt/upnp/MediaTomb/Audio/Artists/Pavement -name \*.mp3 | ~/bin/shuffle.py); do mplayer $track; done
</pre>


<p>And the wee shuffle script I whipped together looks like this:</p>

<pre lang="python">
#!/usr/bin/env python
# shuffle.py

import sys
import random

args = list(sys.stdin)
random.shuffle(args)
sys.stdout.writelines(args)
</pre>


<p>And here&#8217;s the convenient shuffle idiom that renders my arg-shuffling script somewhat useless:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
find /mnt/upnp/MediaTomb/Audio/Artists/Pavement -name \*.mp3 | mplayer -playlist - -shuffle -loop 0

    <updated>2009-09-15T08:29:55-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/09/15/i2-survey-results</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/06/20/i2-survey/">wrote</a> in June that the I2 subgroup surveyed &#8220;repository managers to determine the current practices and needs of the repository community regarding institutional identifiers. Results from the survey will inform a set of use cases that will be shared with the community, and that are expected to drive the development of a new standard for institutional identifiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The survey closed in July, and the subgroup spent August writing a report on the survey results.  That report is now <a href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=2773">final</a> and it&#8217;s available to the public.  Feedback may be sent to our (woefully underutilized) public <a href="http://www.niso.org/lists/i2info/">i2info</a> mailing list, left as a comment on this post, or e-mailed to me privately which I can forward to our internal list.</p>

<p>The next step is to build upon the report to draw yet more conclusions from the data &#8211; there&#8217;s an awful lot there &#8211; and flesh out some repository use cases for institutional identifiers.  The I2 core group is moving quickly towards finalizing identifier metadata elements so that a standard may be drafted, and I think having some use cases documented will help drive the standard in a direction the community can get behind.</p>

<p>Onward and upward.</p>

    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/08/10/linking-world-digital-library-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I <a href="http://mjgiarlo.github.com/michael/blog/2009/07/31/validating-ore-from-the-command-line/">mentioned earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve been learning about linked data in the context of dropping it into the <a href="http://www.wdl.org">World Digital Library</a> project.  I am hopeful we&#8217;ll be able to deploy the RDF views ((Sadly, the URIs are uglyish due to some constraints from our caching configuration.  I figure we can redirect uglyish URIs to cool ones and make use of owl:sameAs if those constraints go away.)) before too long.  In advance of that, I thought it might be helpful to share a sample of what our RDF would look like.  The RDF below represents the WDL item for the U.S. Constitution.  I appreciate constructive criticism.</p>

<p>A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mmm, Unicode.</li>
<li>Item types are from the <a href="http://bibliontology.com/">Bibliographic Ontology</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the properties are from the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> ontology, especially used where literals are objects rather than resources identified by URI. </li>
<li>Where possible I dug up or found URIs and used the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> ontology.</li>
<li>An item is modeled as an aggregation of its constituent files, as defined in <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a>.  The notion here is that an ORE aggregation of an item, as expressed in a resource map which is discoverable via a link header in each item detail page, is a &#8220;whole&#8221; item, including all of its files ((<em>sans</em> certain low-quality derivatives such as small thumbnails and tiles for the zoom interface)), metadata, and translations.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m also making light use of the <a href="http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/nfo/">NEPOMUK File Ontology</a> to express that constituent files are files, and to be explicit about file sizes so that folks know in advance of retrieving it how large files are.</li>
<li>Links out to <a href="http://purl.org/NET/decimalised#">DDC</a> (Decimalised Database of Concepts), <a href="http://www.lingvoj.org/">Lingvoj</a>, <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, and <a href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/">Library of Congress Authorities &amp; Vocabularies</a> (e.g., LC Subject Headings) are included where possible.  ((I was poking through the DBpedia output for <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> URIs as well, but my method was way too slow and clunky, so that&#8217;s disabled for the time being.  Clients can always follow their noses from the DBpedia output.)) I&#8217;d be especially stoked to hear of other vocabs I might link to.  The more linked the data, the better.</li>
<li>The output below is Turtle for readability, but the application will offer up RDF/XML.</li>

All through the summer, the delegates debated, drafted, and redrafted the articles of the new Constitution in closed sessions. Among the chief points at issue were how much power to allow the central government, how many representatives in Congress to allow each state, and how these representatives should be elected--directly by the people or by the state legislators.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Is MARC a data model?]]></title>
    <link href="http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/08/10/is-marc-a-data-model/"/>
    <updated>2009-08-10T08:49:55-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/08/10/is-marc-a-data-model</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted a status update to <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/statuses/3215173861">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/7827179">identi.ca</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/mjgiarlo?story_fbid=255213260600">Facebook</a> late last night hoping to suss out two questions:<ol>
<li>Is MARC a data model?</li>
<li>But really: what qualifies something as a data model?</li>
</ol></p>

<p>I&#8217;d poked around looking for clues to the latter and was left cold by the long Wikipedia entry.  Maybe I&#8217;ve been doing the micro-blog thing for too long and my ability to parse information that comes in greater-than-140-character chunks has been damaged.  Plus I like learning from examples, and what better example for the library geek than MARC?</p>

<p>The feedback I received was pretty impressive, and not all of it consistent with the rest.  I found it an interesting example of crowdsourcing, so to speak.  As each response came in, I would read it, cross-reference with, e.g., Wikipedia articles, for accuracy, and revise my own answers to the above questions.  I&#8217;m honing in on an answer to the former question.  The latter question is still a bit murky.</p>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d share the responses, too.  Responses from Twitter are included in full w/ links to the original.  Responses from quasi-public Facebook have been anonymized.  You can see my replies interspersed as well and watch the evolution of the (admittedly short) discussion.  After the jump:</p>

<!--more-->


<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/bangpound/statuses/3215214058">@bangpound</a>: @mjgiarlo MARC is a markup language. It makes no declarations about how data is stored only how it&#8217;s formatted.</a></blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/ranginui/statuses/3215591211">@ranginui</a>: @mjgiarlo a piece of crap, cue neil young and crazy horse</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/anarchivist/statuses/3216566687">@anarchivist</a>: @mjgiarlo not a data model, it&#8217;s a transmission format</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/vphill/statuses/3216984096">@vphill</a>: @mjgiarlo I&#8217;ve heard that said about MARC too, let me know if you get an answer</blockquote>




<blockquote>A container for a data model, such as AACR2</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/statuses/3217501084">@mjgiarlo</a>: @bangpound, @anarchivist, @vphill: So. let&#8217;s see: MARC21 bib is a profile of a serialization/transmission format w/ AACR2 as the data model? </blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/anarchivist/statuses/3219349208">@anarchivist</a>: @mjgiarlo wouldn&#8217;t even assume AACR2 if I was you.</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/statuses/3223365237">@mjgiarlo</a>: @anarchivist: Okay. Something says &#8220;authors go in 100; contributors go in 700,&#8221; though, right? Is that not a data model? Sorry if dense.</blockquote>




<blockquote>MARC is not a data model (and neither is AACR2) in the sense that neither of them explicitly describes entities and relationships among entities. The relationships in these two non-relational frameworks are implicit, and the semantics of the model must be supplied in the end by the people who use these frameworks. RDA/FRBR is a move toward an actual data model &#8211; it makes some relationships explicit and can properly be represented in an Entity-Relationship diagram (with all those relationship words that explicitly express the semantics &#8211; words like, for example, &#8220;is realized through&#8221; or &#8220;is embodied in&#8221; or &#8220;is exemplified by&#8221;), but even RDA/FRBR does not fully express all of the relationships/semantics and must be translated into an actual data model in order to be implemented &#8211; librarians have been irresponsible, in my opinion, in refusing to learn about relational database concepts, mostly because of their slavish adherence to the old flat-file style that MARC represents.</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/gmcharlt/statuses/3223446556">@gmcharlt</a>: @mjgiarlo MARC is many things at once, which is part of the problem. Not just transmission standard; embodies current cataloging worldview</blockquote>




<blockquote><a href="http://twitter.com/edsu/statuses/3224290838">@edsu</a>: @mjgiarlo i think there are aspects of data modeling in Z39.2 & ISO 2709, and certainly in MARC21 ; that said, i think @gmcharlt is right.</blockquote>


<p>So, based on all the responses I&#8217;ve gotten (on Facebook, on Twitter, around the office), here&#8217;s my current thinking:</p>

<ul>
<li>MARC means more than one thing.</li>
<li>One meaning of MARC is MARC the binary format. A format is not a data model.</li>
<li>Another meaning of MARC is, e.g., MARC21 Bibliographic.</li>
<li>MARC21 Bibliographic is a profile of MARC, which is serialized in the MARC binary format.</li>
<li>MARC21 Bibliographic defines semantics for fields and subfields and indicators, which makes it feel like a data model.  This gets at some of the assumptions I&#8217;ve internalized about data models.</li>
<li>The MARC21 Bibliographic data model thus has well-defined entities, but otherwise is a poor data model, primarily because:<ol>
<li>It does not have well-defined relationships between the entities;</li>
<li>It conflates different conceptual models, such as the FRBR Group 1 entities and also mixes FRBR Group 1 entities with Group 2 and 3 entities.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I&#8217;m not sure where this leaves AACR2, but it feels like it just fell out of the discussion.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;d be pleased if the discussion continued.  If nothing else, it really satisfies my curiosity and gets my brain going (which is useful on a Monday morning).</p>

    <link href="http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/07/31/validating-ore-from-the-command-line/"/>
    <updated>2009-07-31T14:52:54-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/07/31/validating-ore-from-the-command-line</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been periodically poking at getting <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a>/RDF views hooked into the <a href="http://www.wdl.org/">World Digital Library</a> web application, following <a href="http://inkdroid.org/journal/">Ed Summers</a>&#8217; <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lod/2009May/0301.html">lead</a> from his work on <a href="http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/">Chronicling America</a>.  The RDF views also use the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/ore/">OAI-ORE</a> vocabulary to express aggregations &#8211; in WDL, an item is an aggregation of its constituent files.  The goal is to provide a semantically rich and holistic representation of a WDL item (identifier, constituent files, metadata, translations, and so on).</p>

<p>The ORE format is a new one for me so it&#8217;s hard to say whether the output of my dev branch is valid ORE or not.  Plus I&#8217;m a sucker for validators.  Turns out <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~azaroth/">Rob Sanderson</a> has developed a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/foresite-toolkit/">Python library for validating ORE</a>, and this little snippet is what I&#8217;ve been using to validate the ORE.  I didn&#8217;t put much effort into making it readable, so much as banging something functional out so I can meet deadlines, so mea culpa and all that.  But without further hemming and hawing, the code:</p>

<pre lang="python">
# validate.py
import sys
from foresite import *

rem = RdfLibParser().parse(ReMDocument(sys.argv[1]))
aggr = rem.aggregation
n3 = RdfLibSerializer('n3')
rem2 = aggr.register_serialization(n3)
print rem2.get_serialization(n3).data
</pre>


<p>Most of this code is naively copied and pasted from Rob&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/foresite-toolkit/wiki/PythonLibrary">Foresite documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I invoke it thusly: <code>python validate.py {URL}</code></p>

<p>And the output:</p>

    <link href="http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/07/13/wdl-metadata-mapping-and-parsing-tei-in-python/"/>
    <updated>2009-07-13T18:27:46-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/07/13/wdl-metadata-mapping-and-parsing-tei-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Context</h2>


<p>Early on in the effort to develop the first public version of the World Digital Library <a href="http://www.wdl.org/">web application</a>, we developed a (non-public) Django-based cataloging application where Library of Congress catalogers could manage metadata for WDL items.  Management in this sense includes creation of records, editing of records, versioning of edits, mapping of source records, and some light workflow for assignment of records to individual catalogers and for hooking into translation processes ((Catalogers cataloged stuff in the English language, but every metadata record needed to be translated into the other six U.N. languages: Spanish, Russian, French, Arabic, Chinese, and Portuguese.)).</p>

<p>I worked primarily on the source record mapping tools.  They take a number of formats as input and are called by the cataloging application to map metadata from these formats into the WDL domain model.  Several though not all of which are XML-based, and thus easily dealt with in Python, via the <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/api.html">etree module in the lxml package</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">Dan</a> recently kicked off a new R&amp;D project for evaluating (any) metadata against any number of metadata profiles, mapping into a generic data dictionary, the goal being to determine how feasible it would be to develop a toolset for aiding remediation of metadata across any number of digital collections.  I have been working on this project with Dan, and got started by seeing how generalizable the WDL metadata mapping tools are.  Turns out they&#8217;re fairly generalizable once you tweak the various format-specific mapping rules to map into the generic data dictionary model rather than the WDL model (around 15 elements, and somewhere between Dublin Core and MODS in terms of specificity but flatly structured like DC).</p>

<p>Some of the test data I am working with now, that has nothing to do with WDL, is SGML-based <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/t/tei/">TEI 2</a> markup.  The closest I worked with on WDL was <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/html/MS.html">TEI P5 for manuscript description</a> which is serialized in XML.  Turns out my TEI mapping rules from before blew up on this TEI 2 stuff, as lxml.etree (naturally) wasn&#8217;t digging the non-XML input.  I googled around a bit for how best to parse TEI (or any SGML) in Python and then discovered it&#8217;s actually simple as pie.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>


<p>If you&#8217;ve got the <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a> module installed ((And you are but one <code>sudo easy_install BeautifulSoup</code> away from that.)):</p>

<pre lang="python">
>>> from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
>>> tei = open('foo.sgm').read()
>>> BeautifulSoup(tei).findAll('title')[0].string
u'[Memorandum to Dr. Botkin]: a machine readable transcription.'
</pre>


<p>If not, the <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/lxmlhtml.html">lxml.html</a> module works too:</p>

<pre lang="python">
>>> from lxml import html
>>> h = html.parse(open('foo.sgm'))
>>> h.xpath('//title')[0].text
'[Memorandum to Dr. Botkin]: a machine readable transcription.'
</pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[<a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/niso-i2/">Series</a>]</p>

<p>Near the end of my <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/06/13/i2-strawman/">strawman post</a>, I wrote:<blockquote>The I2 repositories subgroup will be sending out its survey on identifier use cases in the coming week.  It will be interesting to see if the requirements we have thus far identified still obtain in light of the data we collect from the survey. </blockquote></p>

<p>We completed the survey late last week and began distributing it.  Here&#8217;s what we sent out:<blockquote><p>The NISO I2 Working Group is surveying repository managers to determine the current practices and needs of the repository community regarding institutional identifiers.  We value your time and your input in the process to create a standard for a new institutional identifier.  We hope that you will complete the survey which should take less than 15 minutes.  The survey will remain open through Monday, July 6th.</p></p>

<p>
Here is a link to the survey:

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>First we used <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a> to send the survey link to approximately one-hundred repository managers that the subgroup identified.   Our process for identifying repository managers involved pulling together a list of prominent repositories from subgroup members, and then gathering more from <a href="http://www.opendoar.org/">OpenDOAR</a>, &#8220;an authoritative directory of academic open access repositories.&#8221;  Then subgroup members were encouraged to share the survey link with colleagues, and post it far and wide via blogs, listservs, and <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo/status/2230486784">tweets</a>.  The listservs we targeted were: <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/archives/jisc-repositories.html">JISC-REPOSITORIES</a>, <a href="http://metadatalibrarians.monarchos.com/">metadataLibrarians</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-curation">digital-curation</a>, <a href="https://arl.org/Lists/SPARC-IR/">SPARC-IR</a>, <a href="http://mailman.anu.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/ir-net">ir-net</a>, <a href="http://www.lsoft.com/SCRIPTS/WL.EXE?SL1=REPOMAN-L&H=LISTSERV.INDIANA.EDU">REPOMAN-L</a>, <a href="http://larch.palinet.org/archives/palinet-ir-l.html">PALINET-IR-L</a>, <a href="http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/dspace-general">dspace-general</a>, <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fedora-commons-users">fedora-commons-users</a>, <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/identifiers/">DC-IDENTIFIERS</a>, and <a href="http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mailing-lists/code4lib/">code4lib</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already received a few responses and have gotten useful feedback.  Two of the hardest questions to answer so far have been: &#8220;What is an institutional identifier?&#8221; and &#8220;What is a repository?&#8221;</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Institutional identifier</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An institutional identifier is defined as a symbol or code that uniquely identifies an institution.  Domain-specific examples of existing identifiers include SAN, IPEDS, GLN, MARC Org Code, and ISIL.  Another example might be a Handle prefix or ARK name authority assigning number.</p></dd>
<dt><strong>Repository</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Institutional repositories and subject repositories like arxiv.org are clearly &#8216;repositories&#8217;, but beyond that it is a somewhat ill-defined term.  One might look to the <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html">Kahn-Wilensky architecture</a>, or the <a href="http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0b1.pdf">OAIS reference model (PDF)</a>, or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_repository">Wikipedia</a> for definitions, but it&#8217;s not clear that even the authorities agree on what constitutes a repository.</p><p>It&#8217;s a system.  It&#8217;s network-accessible and typically has a web interface of some sort.  Files and groups of files sometimes known as objects tend to be deposited in them, perhaps for some combination of management, access, or preservation.  Many run Fedora, DSpace, and ePrints, and factor heavily in scholarly communication.  Some are document-centric.  Some will accept anything.  To some, a learning management system may be a repo.  To others, a content management system may fit.</p>
<p>My background is in academia so my own definition is somewhat based in that context, but I wouldn&#8217;t say the term is necessarily limited to that context.  There are other NISO I2 scenarios for library workflows and electronic resources, so it&#8217;s safe to assume that repository does not mean ILS or OPAC or ERP system.  My hope is that folks have their own working definitions of the term and can decide for themselves what it means.</p></dd>
</dl>


<p>We&#8217;ve given folks a little over two weeks to respond to the survey, so the constant I2 drum-beating will quiet down for a while around here.  I am very interested in what sorts of responses we get from the survey.  Fun times!</p>

<p>Oh, and perhaps it goes without saying, but if you&#8217;re a repository owner, manager, expert, developer, or stakeholder with an interest in identifiers, please feel free to take the <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=RGQgZ3090DVrb3kFzr3P3Q_3d_3d">survey</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"></p>


<p style="text-align: left;">[<a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/niso-i2/">Series</a>]</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">In the prior I2 post, I wrote about the requirements the repositories subgroup has come up with for an institutional identifier standard (with the hope that our findings re: repositories could be generalized to other scenarios).</p>

</div>


<p style="text-align: left;">My strawman proposal of sorts is to explore how well <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">linked data patterns</a> fit this problem space.  Linked data, briefly, is a way to expose and link data on the web in a more semantically meaningful way, and is often summarized using the four principles put forward by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>:</p>




<blockquote style="text-align: left;">
<ol>
    <li>Use URIs as names for things</li>
    <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
    <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information.</li>
    <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p style="text-align: left;">That&#8217;s the crux of it.Â  Linked data takes well-known patterns on the web (linking, dereferencing, etc.) and applies them to data, which in this case could be metadata for identifying institutions.</p>


<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s examine each of the requirements and the applicability of linked data thereto.</p>




<ol style="text-align: left;">
    <li><em>Should be agnostic to type of institution, e.g., libraries, museums, personal collections, historical societies</em>: The web is already agnostic to type of institution.Â  HTTP URIs do not favor one type of institution over another.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should handle varying institutional granularity, e.g., institution-level, campus-level, division-level, unit-level</em>: HTTP <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> are flexible in this regard.Â  Hierarchy, should one wish it to be surfaced in the identifier, may be encoded in either a DNS hostname or the path appended to the DNS name.Â  One can imagine a URI like &#8220;http://department.division.institution.tld/unit/subunit&#8221; or &#8220;http://institution.tld/campus/office/individual&#8221;. <br/><br/>Hierarchy needn&#8217;t be surfaced in the identifier if one favors opacity, in which case &#8220;http://registry.tld/xnjsdasd&#8221; would suffice as an identifier, and may instead be entirely reflected in the (RDF) representation returned by dereferencing the URI.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should handle linking among institutions and subordinate units</em>: Linked data handles linking via well-known HTTP mechanisms, referenced in the fourth principle of linked data.Â  Unlike the HTTP link, which has limited semantics, linked data links are semantically rich and extensible.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should express different sorts of relationships among these institutions and units</em>: The &#8220;useful information&#8221; in the third principle of linked data is typically provided by an RDF representation, which is itself a list of assertions.Â  These assertions, or triples, consist of subjects, predicates, and objects.Â  The ability to express the relationships in this requirement is limited only by the availability of vocabularies that contain sets of predicates and classes for subjects and objects.Â  Think of the predicates as elements defined within a metadata standard, e.g., <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/">Dublin Core</a> &#8220;creator&#8221;, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a> &#8220;relatedItem&#8221;, and so forth.Â  Vocabularies that contain these predicates and classes are growing and evolving daily, and should there not be a vocabulary that contains the relationship one wishes to express, it is fairly easy to create a custom vocabulary. <br/><br/>The ability to mix and match vocabularies provides an expressiveness that is often not found in document-based metadata formats and the flexibility to express radically different relationships on a per-industry or per-institution basis.Â  This latter point is important as the I2 group has identified both core metadata elements for identifying institutions of different types and additional elements for specific types of institutions.Â  Why re-invent a new metadata format or schema when all one needs to express may already be contained in others?<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should relate to existing relevant identifiers and registries</em>: Same as requirement#4.Â  Linked data is all about expressing relationships between things, e.g., institutions, identifiers, registries, etc.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should be globally unique</em>: HTTP URIs are guaranteed to be globally unique by virtue of the distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_system">DNS</a> system and hierarchical naming within each HTTP service.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should be actionable</em>: HTTP URIs provide dereferenceability/actionability via the well-known HTTP protocol.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should enable retrieval of metadata sufficient to identify the institution, which may vary widely by institution</em>: HTTP URIs are actionable per requirement #7 and the metadata returned is flexible per requirement #4.<br/></li>
    <li><em>Should accommodate changes as institutions come and go and re-organize and be able to relate defunct institutions to new ones</em>: Linked data patterns provide for redirecting from defunct representations (institutional identifiers) to new ones via HTTP redirects.Â  One may also add assertions to institutional metadata such as owl:sameAs, for instance, which says that the institution identified by the given URI is the same as another institution identified by another URI.<br/></li>
</ol>


<p>This seems like a compelling path to follow for the I2 standard.</p>

<p>The I2 repositories subgroup will be sending out its survey on identifier use cases in the coming week.Â  It will be interesting to see if the requirements we have thus far identified still obtain in light of the data we collect from the survey.Â  If so, I would like to explore the idea of linked data for institutional identifiers a bit more.</p>

    <updated>2009-06-07T17:14:56-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/06/07/i2-requirements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[<a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/niso-i2/">Series</a>]</p>

<p>The I2 IR scenario subgroup approached the issue of institutional identifiers in repositories by first brainstorming about the various issues, problems, and sticking points that make identifiers in this space (and elsewhere) such a complex topic.  Folks on the subgroup are repository managers or are otherwise involved with or knowledgeable about the repository space, so the brainstorming exercise yielded a good number of concerns.</p>

<p>The purpose of the exercise was to enumerate concerns and issues that could inform a draft survey to be administered to repository managers and experts around the globe in different organizational contexts: libraries, subject disciplines, archives, historical societies, etc.  The purpose of the survey is to get an idea of the use cases and constraints around institutional identifiers in these different repository contexts, the assumption being that we ought to have requirements grounded in real world usage before we go off building a standard.</p>

<p>I will note here that the subgroup has worked up a draft survey that has just recently been reviewed by a small group of folks who know about survey design, and we hope to administer the survey to the aforementioned <em>Reporati</em> this week ((We will also x-post to repo-related mailing lists as well, and some of us may blog or tweet about it.  My inclination is to cast as wide a net as possible so as not to miss important use cases.  We can always scope things out later on, but it&#8217;s useful to be inclusive at this point lest our own assumptions carry the group forward.)).  Which is to say that I don&#8217;t yet have a strong grasp of the use cases out there in the wild, and this series should be construed as my own premature cognitive fumblings.  But let&#8217;s assume for now that what we learn from the survey results matches our initial brainstorming exercise.</p>

<p>Here is a slightly modified and boiled down version of the concerns and issues the subgroup came up with for a potential institutional identifier standard, which resembles a set of minimum requirements:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Should be agnostic to type of institution, e.g., libraries, museums, personal collections, historical societies</li>
    <li>Should handle varying institutional granularity, e.g., institution-level, campus-level, division-level, unit-level</li>
    <li>Should handle linking among institutions and subordinate units</li>
    <li>Should express different sorts of relationships among these institutions and units</li>
    <li>Should relate to existing relevant identifiers and registries</li>
    <li>Should be globally unique</li>
    <li>Should be actionable</li>
    <li>Should enable retrieval of metadata sufficient to identify the institution, which may vary widely by institution</li>
    <li>Should accommodate changes as institutions come and go and re-organize and be able to relate defunct institutions to new ones</li>
</ol>


<p>I doubt the list is exhaustive; I am almost certain we will uncover all sorts of tangly and esoteric use cases that add requirements.  I expect it.  Why else would we be gathering to discuss the need for an institutional identifier if it were a solved problem or a simple one?  ((The cynical among you might have interesting answers to this question.))</p>

<p>Nevertheless, looking at the above list, the task we&#8217;ve taken on starts to feel less onerous.  And thinking about identifier systems constrained by the list of concerns, the mind starts to cook up all sorts of possible solutions.  I&#8217;ll share one in the next post in this series, a strawman proposal of sorts, and how it addresses each of these requirements.</p>

    <updated>2009-05-19T15:16:19-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjgiarlo.github.com/blog/2009/05/19/i2-background</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[<a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/category/niso-i2/">Series</a>]</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts about institutional identifiers ((I offer that very tentatively, knowing what a <a href="http://mjgiarlo.github.com/michael/blog/category/development/ruby/">spectacular failure</a> my last attempt at a series was.)).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/05/18/state-of-the-me/">my last post</a>, I alluded to some documentation that I&#8217;ve written.  That was somewhat misleading, which will soon be apparent, but I liked the parallel construction I had going, and I am but a slave to orderliness.</p>

<p>For about the past six months, I have been working with a <a href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/i2">NISO group</a> looking into how institutions are identified within information systems:</p>

<blockquote>
The I2 (Institutional Identifiers &#8211; pronounced &#8220;I 2&#8221;) working group will build on work from the Journal Supply Chain Efficiency Improvement Pilot (http://www.journalsupplychain.com/), which demonstrated the improved efficiencies of using an institutional identifier in the journal supply chain. The NISO working group will develop a standard for an institutional identifier that can be implemented in all library and publishing environments. The standard will include definition of the metadata required to be collected with the identifier and what uses can be made of that metadata. &#8230;
</blockquote>


<p>The I2 group is split into a few subgroups which have been charged with looking into how institutional identifiers are used in particular scenarios.  These scenarios are e-resources, repositories and e-learning systems, and library resource workflows.  The scenario names pain me a bit, but so be it; this is our industry, and there are bigger windmills to tilt at.</p>

<p>I am currently co-chairing the subgroup looking at repositories and e-learning, and apparently I am its &#8220;tech lead.&#8221;  I don&#8217;t want to get caught up on names and roles and titles, though; this series isn&#8217;t about those at all.  I&#8217;m just setting the scene and explaining why my head&#8217;s in this space and laying bare my stake in the issue.</p>

<p>The remainder of this series will provide a bit more detail on the issues around institutional identifiers, share how the repository subgroup is grappling with identifier issues and engaging the repository community to assess needs, propose an approach for an identifier system that may meet said needs, and explore what seems to be the thorniest issue ((Hint: management.  I know, &#8220;duh,&#8221; right?)).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Has it really been two months?  Why, yes, it has.  Oh me, oh my.  I have tried to stick somewhat loosely to a schedule of writing here once a month ((Here I extend my hand and then imagine you, whomever you may be, smacking it ever so gently)), but alas, April came and went and I simply made no time to write.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not entirely true; I did plenty of writing:</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://www.wdl.org/">code</a>.  After a year of working on the World Digital Library project at <a href="http://loc.gov/">$MPOW</a>, we went live on April 21st.  The last few weeks were very busy for the development team, but I did find a few moments to breathe and blink.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://identi.ca/mjgiarlo">microblog</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mjgiarlo">updates</a>.  After months of trying to figure out what microblogging is all about ((Wondered: Is it IM?  Status updates?  Blogging?  And how is it related to these?  Concluded: it&#8217;s a little of each, and somehow it fits my status/vanity/sharing needs perfectly.)), it found its way into my daily routine.  When time is short or thoughts arise fast and fuzzy, microblogging is a useful public scratchpad.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/presentations/njla2009/">slides</a>.  The kind folks over at the College and University Section of the New Jersey Library Association invited me to be a panelist at the <a href="http://njla.pbworks.com/Conference+2009">2009 NJLA conference</a>.  The panel addressed recentish developments in open source integrated library systems.  I spoke about the <a href="http://evergreen-ils.org/">Evergreen ILS</a> ((Hat tip to <a href="http://esilibrary.com/">Equinox Software Inc.</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/">Karen G. Schneider</a> for her kind assistance.)) and my co-panelists spoke about <a href="http://koha.org/">Koha</a> and the <a href="http://oleproject.org/">Open Library Environment Project</a>.</p>

<p>And, ever the dutiful technologist, I wrote documentation.  And that will be the subject of <a href="http://lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2009/05/19/i2-background/">my next post</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I confess: prior to today, I had never heard of Ada Lovelace.  <a href="http://jodischneider.com/blog/2009/03/24/remembering-sarah-seastone/">A</a> <a href="http://rosalynmetz.com/ideas/2009/03/24/jodi-schneider-the-best-cheerleader-ever/">number</a> <a href="http://bibwild.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/ada-lovelace-day/">of</a> <a href="http://www.eifl.net/cps/sections/services/eifl-foss/foss-blog/2009_03_24_ada-lovelace-day-bess">bloggers</a> <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/2009/03/24/bess-sadler-library-geek/">whom</a> <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/bess/?p=172">I</a> <a href="http://digitaleccentric.blogspot.com/2009/03/ada-lovelace-day.html">follow</a> <a href="http://www.semanticlibrary.net/2009/03/24/ada-lovelace-day/">wrote</a> about Ms. Lovelace today, which is apparently Ada Lovelace Day: &#8220;an international day of blogging to draw attention to women excelling in technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inspired by their words, I thought I would say my piece as well.  And so, this being the first Ada Lovelace Day, I&#8217;d like to celebrate the woman who is most responsible for my own love of libraries ((I realize Ada Lovelace Day is about technology, not about libraries, but I hope you&#8217;ll give me some slack.)) and technology: my mother, Diane.  My mother is neither a technologist nor a mathematician, and I&#8217;m pretty sure she&#8217;s not comfortable in front of a Python interpreter.  She was an employee at Rutgers University&#8217;s Alexander Library during their first automation efforts in the &#8217;70s, partly while I was <em>in utero</em>.  I like to think that library automation entered my bloodstream through osmosis back in 1973 and I&#8217;ve been working at this, well, not quite since then, but long enough.  More than that, she got me hooked on libraries many years ago through frequent trips to neighborhood libraries and also by including me, in snot-nosed kid form, in her genealogical research that took us to some rural Maryland libraries and, yes, the Library of Congress.  This thirst for knowledge (not to mention her constant and unwavering support for me despite the wacky paths I&#8217;ve chosen over the years) is why I celebrate my mother today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Former colleague Trevor Dawes has written a thorough <a href="http://trevordawes.blogspot.com/2009/02/rutgers-sagacontinued.html">piece</a> about a name change proposed by the faculty of Rutgers&#8217; School of Communication, Information and Library Studies (SCILS).  They have voted on and approved a new name, School of Communication and Information, and it is now awaiting approval from the Board of Governors.</p>

<p>Trevor received e-mail from a current SCILS faculty member after getting involved in a discussion of the name change on a listserv.  I find part of that e-mail ((Taken out of context, true.)), specifically the rationale for the name change, absolutely puzzling:<blockquote>We just have so many programs now &#8211; we can&#8217;t possibly cover all of them in our school&#8217;s name. School of Communication and Information is something of a compromise name, but it does encompass all our departments and programs in the school. </blockquote></p>

<p>So in order to cover more programs, the name of the school ought to communicate less?  Does dropping &#8220;Library Studies&#8221; somehow represent Journalism, Media Studies, and Informatics students more?</p>

<p>I fail to see how removing &#8220;Library Studies&#8221; makes the name of the school <em>more</em> meaningful.  Why not follow this rationale to its logical conclusion, then, and shorten the name to School of Information?  Or iSchool?  Or how about &#8220;School?&#8221;  Yes, that&#8217;s it, &#8220;School!&#8221;  Then all the departments and programs are equally well-represented.  Huzzah, faculty!</p>

<p>I should be clear about my objection.  I don&#8217;t mind SCILS becoming an iSchool.  In fact, I think my education there could have benefited from a more iSchoolish curriculum.  But any problems with the school then were not related to the name, and I doubt they are now.  What I object to is the oddball rationale for the name change, and the notion that in order to affect change and improve the school, well, clearly a change in name will do the trick!  It&#8217;s putting the cart before the horse, especially when the MLIS program lacks a core curriculum ((An opportunity for real change, though I will admit that there are good arguments against having one.)).  This is change in name only and that is perhaps a missed opportunity.</p>
