  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of interesting stories regarding open source library projects have come out during the past few days.</p>

<p>First, Carl Grant, the former CEO of <a href="http://vtls.com/" target="_blank">VTLS</a>, is forming a new company devoted to providing and building services for open source software. The name of the company is <a target="_blank" href="http://care-affiliates.com/pr1.html">CARe Affiliates</a>, and they have already struck a deal with open source software provider <a target="_blank" href="http://indexdata.dk/">Index Data</a> (creators of Zebra, YAZ, YAZ Proxy, Metaproxy, Keystone, and so forth).  I have worked just a bit with Carl and he seems to be a stand-up guy.  Best of luck, Carl.</p>

<p>Second, <a target="_blank" href="http://open-ils.org/blog/?p=91">the Mellon Foundation has approached the GPLS</a> with great interest in the open source ILS, <a href="http://open-ils.org/" target="_blank">Evergreen</a>. Where this is going is yet to be seen, but it&#8217;s something to keep an eye on. It could be a fantastic opportunity for libraries that are frustrated with their current ILS and have the resources to commit development time.  (With an assumption that the former set is vastly larger than the latter set.)  This could be very exciting.</p>

<p>Those who <strong>still</strong> doubt that open source in libraries is a legitimate movement must find it more and more difficult to justify their arguments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Matt Zumwalt of <a href="http://yourmediashelf.com/" target="_blank">MediaShelf, LLC</a> has been hard at work thinking about how to make <a href="http://fedora.info/" target="_blank">Fedora</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer" target="_blank">RESTful</a>.  There is now a <a href="http://www.fedora.info/wiki/index.php/RESTful_Fedora_Proposal" target="_blank">proposal on the Fedora wiki</a> based on a PDF he sent to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=fedora-commons-developers" target="_blank">fedora-commons-developers list</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an interesting proposal.  I&#8217;ve read over the PDF version quickly but it does bear a closer read.</p>

<p>Whether SOAP or REST is more appropriate for a Fedora API is something I&#8217;m not sure about, though I don&#8217;t mean to imply it&#8217;s an either/or situation.</p>

<p>Goodness, why give the author the satisfaction of a response?  It lends his or her points a certain credence that they would otherwise lack.  This, my friends, is little more than the sound <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/blog/main/2007/06/web-20-the-sleep-of-reason-part-i/"></a> of irrelevance.  It will pass in time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At long last, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/Toc_views.asp?sid=B9KRK3DL5LA88K9NC1ENHM48GKDQ0AJ0&TOCName=J201v04n01_TOC&desc=Volume%3A%204%20Issue%3A%201%2F2">paper</a> that Ron Jantz and I wrote for the Journal of Archival Organization has been published in a special double issue.  It&#8217;s titled &#8220;Digital Archiving and Preservation: Technologies and Processes for a Trusted Repository&#8221; and is intended to be a fairly nitty-gritty piece on digital preservation (in the context of trusted repositories) <strong>for archivists</strong>.  The abstract:<blockquote>This article examines what is implied by the term &#8220;trusted&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;trusted digital repositories.&#8221; Digital repositories should be able to preserve electronic materials for periods at least comparable to existing preservation methods. Our collective lack of experience with preserving digital objects and consensus about the reliability of our technological infrastructure raises questions about how we should proceed with digital-based preservation practices, an emerging role for academic libraries and archival institutions. This article reviews issues relating to building a trusted digital repository, highlighting some of the issues raised and possible solutions proposed by the authors in their work of implementing and acculturating a digital repository at Rutgers University Libraries.</blockquote>
This special double-issue of JAO will also be released in the <a href="http://www.haworthpress.com/store/product.asp?sid=0MEHAR64F60N9J3KA44B3X8836FHDSK6&sku=6008&detail=Contents" target="_blank">manuscript</a>, &#8220;Archives and the Digital Library.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thanks to editors Bill Landis, Robin Chandler, Tom Frusciano, and Caryn Radick for seeing this through.  And of course to Ron Jantz for getting me interested in this crazy stuff at a time when I had no direction or interest in my career.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend and former colleague asked if I would comment on a chapter in her upcoming book on digital rights management and I agreed.  The chapter is about identification and authenticity of web resources.  Throughout my review of the chapter, I kept coming back to a couple of very basic notions that underlie any effort to provide persistent identifiers for web resources.  These notions are, to my mind, central to identifier persistence, and any other concerns rely upon this foundation:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identifier persistence requires an organizational commitment.  Persistence cannot be ensured by a few renegades in the skunk-works, nor can it be mandated from on high without the support of those who manage the identifiers or produce web resources.  <strong>All individuals involved in the life-cycle of web resources must be committed to persistence in perpetuity if true persistence of identifiers is to be achieved.</strong></li>
    <li>No technology, no standard, no identifier scheme, no information architecture will get you persistence.  Whether you choose native URIs, Handles, DOIs, PURLs, ARKs, UUIDs, or XRIs, <strong>you will never achieve identifier persistence without active management of your identifiers and web resources</strong>.  This requires the aforementioned organizational commitment since such management cannot occur without sufficient resources.  Management of web resources and identifiers requires time and due diligence and those don&#8217;t come for free.</li>
</ol>


<p>And, at the risk of being reductive, that&#8217;s about it.  Once you&#8217;ve got an organizational commitment and a person or team to manage your identifiers and web resources, the rest of the decisions are secondary.  If you like semantically meaningful URLs that redirect, choose Handles; if you prefer opaque identifiers, go with ARKs; if you don&#8217;t want to run your own software, consider PURLs.  At that point, it <strong>really doesn&#8217;t matter</strong> which scheme you choose, as long as its characteristics match your organization&#8217;s values.  You&#8217;ve already done the heavy lifting; rest easy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was stoked to see our <a href="http://library.princeton.edu/hr/positions/JobLibDigitalInitiativesCoord.html" target="_blank">Digital Initiatives Coordinator</a> position posted earlier today.  We have been without a full-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_rank#Field_or_Senior_officers" target="_blank">field officer</a> for nearly eight months, though <a href="http://weblog.kevinclarke.info/" target="_blank">Kevin Clarke</a> (lead programmer) has served with distinction &#8211; and with nary a complaint!  (Well, okay, there may have been some complaints, but he always had a smile on his face.)</p>

<p>Here are some reasons you might consider this position:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A chance to get in on the ground floor &#8211; our team is still undecided on many important issues, so you would have the opportunity to shape the organization.</li>
    <li>Work with a broad range of technologies, such as Java, Ruby, XQuery, XForms, native XML databases, Solr, and more.</li>
    <li>Assist in the ongoing effort to select repositories for various use cases  &#8211; we&#8217;re evaluating DSpace, several Fedora front-ends, and the X-Hive/DB native XML database</li>
    <li>Many rare and beautiful library collections.</li>
    <li>Great location &#8211; it hardly seems like New Jersey!</li>
    <li>Lead the digital collections team, currently consisting of four librarian programmers and five digitization gurus.</li>
        <li>Forge ties with one of the finest faculties in academia.</li>
    <li>Comprehensive benefits package &#8211; 24 days vacation, the whole insurance kit and kaboodle, and so on.</li>
    <li>Uncommon amount of support (financial and otherwise) for professional development.</li>
    <li>&#8230; and you get to work with me!  But seriously, the great team we have assembled has been a big part of why I&#8217;ve thoroughly enjoyed my time at Princeton.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can get a sense of the work we&#8217;ve been doing by browsing our <a href="http://diglib.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Collections</a>, though that&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg, and the site will be overhauled in the coming months.</p>

<p>Have some digital initiatives experience?  Ready for leadership responsibilities and an environment in which you will hone your vision?  Then by all means, <a href="http://library.princeton.edu/hr/positions/JobLibDigitalInitiativesCoord.html">check it out</a>.  An MLS is not required.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe I&#8217;m late to the party &#8211; nods to <a href="http://www.blyberg.net/2007/05/30/yes-to-all-yes-to-all/" target="_blank">John Blyberg</a> and <a href="http://www.dynamicorange.com/blog/archives/interaction-design/microsoft_in_on.html" target="_blank">Rob Styles</a> &#8211; but damn(!), does Microsoft have some exciting visualization projects or what?</p>

<p>John and Rob wrote about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/" target="_blank">Microsoft Surface</a>, a hardware/software combination that allows for tactile manipulation of data.  In Microsoft&#8217;s own words:</p>

<blockquote>
Microsoft Surface represents a fundamental change in the way we interact with digital content.

With Surface, we can actually grab data with our hands, and move information between objects with natural gestures and touch.

Surface features a 30-inch tabletop display whose unique abilities allow for several people to work independently or simultaneously. All with out using a mouse or a keyboard.
</blockquote>


<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it; go watch a <a target="_blank" href="http://zdnet.com.com/1606-2_2-6186146.html?tag=nl.e589">demonstration video</a> and be amazed.</p>

<p>But wait, open the video in another window, and keep reading before you lose interest in my uninteresting prose.</p>

<p>I noticed among the recently released <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks" target="_blank">TED talks</a> a brilliant short <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/129" target="_blank">presentation</a> by Microsoft&#8217;s Blaise Aguera y Arcas on their <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/" target="_blank">Photosynth</a> project.  My first impression was just the visual joy of the photo browse / pan / zoom interface.  It&#8217;s impressive in its own right.  But what really tickles me about Photosynth is that it &#8220;takes a large collection of photos of a place or an object, analyzes them for similarities, and displays them in a reconstructed three-dimensional space.&#8221;</p>

<p>For example, throw it at http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/seattlepubliclibrary/ and it will construct a collage-like view of the Seattle Public Library.  Zoom in and you&#8217;ll see images at that level of zoom.  Pan in three dimensions and (assuming there are enough photos to support the various views) you can virtually be in front of SPL.  See for yourself:</p>

<p>Imagine browsing the stacks with this thing.  Imagine finding a book on the stacks and being able to hook directly into its full-text.  Super cool!</p>

<p>Microsoft Surface is tentatively planned for a November release, which will be targeted for &#8220;retail and entertainment settings&#8221;.  It could be available to the public in a few years&#8217; time though it will likely cost a few times more than an average PC. [Gleaned from a Seattle PI <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/317737_msftdevice30.html" target="_blank">article</a>.]  Photosynth is also not available yet, but you can track its progress on the Photosynth team <a href="http://labs.live.com/photosynth/blogs/" target="_blank">blog</a>.  (Yes, there&#8217;s a feed.)</p>

<p><small>[Disclosure: I lived in the shadow of Redmond not long ago, though I was not employed by Microsoft.  I probably invest in Microsoft indirectly, but I haven&#8217;t scoured my portfolio distributions in a while.]</small></p>

</ul>


<p>They reflect pretty clearly the sorts of things that have been on my mind of late.</p>

<p>Also, I saw a very interesting post on Peter Brantley&#8217;s blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.lib.berkeley.edu/shimenawa.php/2007/05/23/ils_abstraction_api">Shimenawa</a>, and I thought it was important enough to share verbatim:</p>

<blockquote>There is considerable ferment these days in the library community about the shortcomings of the current generation of OPAC systems. A number of libraries are investigating replacement discovery systems divorced from their Integrated Library Systems (ILS), and a few have already implemented alternatives. Replacing an integrated OPAC with an external generalized discovery system raises some difficulties, however, as OPACs provide functions beyond simple bibliographic discovery. Among the areas of difficulty are:

    * Handling/displaying complex non-bibliographic library data, such as detailed serial holdings;
    * Providing access to highly volatile ILS transaction data, such as circulation status;
    * Supporting ILS-specific patron functions, such as renewing charged-out books;
    * Supporting institution-specific functions, such as requesting the delivery of books from a remote storage facility.


The inability to provide such popular functions will inhibit the freedom of libraries to use alternative (frequently more modern) discovery platforms for their catalogs.

From the standpoint of libraries it would be ideal to be able to mix-and-match ILS and discovery platforms to suit local needs. To create such a rich environment the library and vendor community will need agreement on the specific technical details of how discovery and ILS systems are to integrate.

DLF is planning to establish a Task Group to analyze the issues involved in integrating ILS and discovery systems, and to create a technical proposal for how such integration should be accomplished. We are now seeking nominations of knowledgeable people to serve on the Task Group. Candidates should have analytic skills, be familiar with ILS and discovery systems, and, ideally, have some experience in systems interoperation. We hope to create a group that has a balance of experience with a variety of specific ILS and discovery systems. We encourage both self-nomination and the nomination of people from the community you believe can contribute to this important effort.

Because we believe the need to regularize interoperation is immediate, we are hoping to name this Task Group within the next several weeks, and that its work can be completed by the end of the calendar year. We expect most of the work of the group to be carried out through telephone and electronic means, although one or two face-to-face meetings may be needed. I have also asked a few experienced people to serve as advisors for the Task Group, to offer help and advice if needed.

<p>Note that although this call went out originally to DLF members, this effort will not be limited to DLFies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It would be an understatement to say I&#8217;ve been enthusiastic about Ruby on Rails for a while now.  Okay, I am downright fanatic &#8211; just look at that shrine to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHH" target="_blank">DHH</a> in my closet; it&#8217;s plain to see that I&#8217;ve drunk the (ruby red) Kool-Aid.</p>

<p>This is the first post in a series in which I hope to share my enthusiasm and explain just what it is that I love about Ruby on Rails.  Not many folks in the library world seem to be using RoR &#8211; with a <a href="http://libraryfind.org/" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bibapp/" target="_blank">notable</a> <a href="http://umlaut.library.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">exceptions</a> &#8211; and so I thought it might be of interest to folks unfamiliar with or curious about Ruby and Rails to hear some impressions from a bright-eyed newbie.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, folks.</p>
