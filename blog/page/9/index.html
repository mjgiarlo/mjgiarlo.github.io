  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided a while back that I would use this space exclusively for library- and technology-related bits, that I should not clutter it with more personal or political matters.  That decision has probably saved me a lot of embarrassment.  But it&#8217;s also kept me from updating more often than I would like, and forced filters upon me that give a one-dimensional view of what I&#8217;m about.  Underlying the decision was a certain trepidation and strange sense of professional propriety &#8211; what would colleagues and potential employers think of me if I just spilled my guts out here?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m starting to question that decision.  Other well-known biblio-bloggers do it &#8211; I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://cavlec.yarinareth.net/" target="_blank">Dorothea</a> and <a href="http://freerangelibrarian.com/" target="_blank">Karen</a> &#8211; though I&#8217;m in the league below the bush league compared to them. But sometimes, dammit, I just want to be me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to add to the left-leaning echo chamber by reminding folks that Jerry Falwell was a lunatic.  People come out of the woodwork to spout ebullient praise about the recently deceased, whether they were actually good people or not, and the posthumous Falwell spin has begun with numerous smiley glad-hands lauding his life and deeds.  But let&#8217;s not forget what kind of guy ol&#8217; Jerry was.  <blockquote><b>I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say &#8216;you helped [the terrorist attacks on 9/11] happen&#8217;.</b></blockquote></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not so crass as to celebrate the death of someone who has arguably done some good during his long lifetime, but I couldn&#8217;t help but think &#8220;good riddance to bad rubbish&#8221; when I heard of his passing.</p>

<p>I am sure there will be dozens of doomsayers scrambling to take his place in the Pantheon of Evangelical Kooks.  I can see it now: <i>And lo, I woke up this morning and my toilet was running.  SURELY THIS IS A SIGN OF THE SECOND COMING.</i></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I kicked around the idea of having a <a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/01/06/barcamp-for-nj-library-geeks/" target="_blank">Library Camp NJ</a> a few months ago.  Response wasn&#8217;t fantastic but, then again, I didn&#8217;t try very hard to spread the word, and perhaps I am not the best champion for the cause.  In the meantime, Baruch College in Manhattan will be sponsoring <a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">Library Camp NYC</a> this August.</p>

<p>I certainly plan on attending if I can get approval to take that day off and may even be talking about this or that if I can come up with an appropriate topic &#8211; Ruby on Rails might be too narrow or technical.  Those of you who are relatively local to NYC should read more about it and consider coming.</p>

<blockquote>
What is a &#8220;Library Camp?&#8221;

The first Library Camp was held at the Ann Arbor District Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan in April 2006 as an &#8220;unconference&#8221; to talk about opportunities and challenges regarding Library 2.0. It was organized by John Blyberg, and went over so well a Library Camp East was held in September 2006 at the Darien Public Library (CT) with about 50 attendees (organized by Alan Gray).

So what&#8217;s an unconference? Unlike a traditional conference, where people have to pay registration fees to sit in an auditorium and listen to someone read off PowerPoint slides, there are no registration fees and everyone is a active participant. Whoever shows up are the right people for an unconference. The discussion topics are decided by the participants when they arrive, as well as topics that are brought to the forefront during discussions that are deemed as particularly important and are thought to be worthy enough by members of the discussion groups to have these topics break off into their own core discussion groups. The format has gained popularity in the technology field in recent years, because it promotes collaboration and engagement.

<p>Here are some of mine:</p>

<ol>
    <li>dmiessler&#8217;s &#8221;<a href="http://dmiessler.com/" target="_blank">grep understanding knowledge</a>&#8221; - He writes about <a href="http://dmiessler.com/archives/1219">society</a>, <a href="http://dmiessler.com/archives/1216">programming</a>, <a href="http://dmiessler.com/study/nix/commands/lsof/">UNIX administration</a>, and his <a href="http://dmiessler.com/archives/1217">personal life</a>.  I enjoy both his writing style and the diversity of topics he covers.  His recent piece about the passing of his grandfather resonated strongly with me, as I&#8217;ve been struggling with having lost my own, one and only, grandfather in December.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.slowleadership.org/index.html" target="_blank">Slow Leadership</a> - Gosh, this is sort of a dirty secret, but I am ridiculously interested in management.  It mystifies me, and it&#8217;s a skill I&#8217;d like to gain and hone someday.  Effective management and leadership are tasks I never expected to have an interest in, but I&#8217;ve been drawn more and more to them the past few years.  Slow Leadership contains a number of insights that I have found quite useful in making sense of how (good) administrators do what they do, and I try to take some of their advice to heart.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.therailsway.com/" target="_blank">The Rails Way</a> - I&#8217;m a programmer by day, and most of my web application work is in the Rails framework.  The Rails Way is written by two Rails committers who know the conventions and good patterns inside and out.  Here&#8217;s how it works: folks submit Rails applications they are working on, and these two rip them apart (in a very constructive and nice way), giving code samples along the way.  It&#8217;s very instructive.  To wit, I&#8217;ve taken more notes on their suggestions than I can shake a stick at.</li>
    <li><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/home/" target="_blank">The Seattle Times</a> - Okay, it&#8217;s not really a blog, but I do read it in my aggregator.  And what can I say?  I can&#8217;t let go.  I still feel like Seattle is my home.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.thestranger.com/blog/" target="_blank">Slog</a> (NSFW) - The Slog is the blog of Seattle&#8217;s alternative weekly newspaper, The Stranger.  It&#8217;s an odd combination of gutter humor, satire, social commentary, political rants, and philosophical bombast.  Where else can you read about deep-fried, beer-battered, bacon-wrapped, spray-cheese-filled hotdogs, analysis of the Alaskan Way viaduct vote, the recent Garrison Keillor flap, and the latest eating establishments in Capitol Hill (Seattle, not D.C.)?</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Is the discipline of computer science on its last legs?  Neil McBride, a lecturer in the School of Computing at De Montfort University, advocates for great change in <a href="http://www.bcs.org/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.9662" target="_blank">The death of computing</a>.  Citing greatly reduced CS enrollment figures in the UK, US, and Australia, and the growing disconnect between industry and academia, McBride argues that computer scientists need to reform the field from within or risk further marginalization and ultimate irrelevance.  Though I can sympathize with his desire to revitalize the discipline, and I understand how perception of computer science might have suffered from the dot-com bust, his message amounts to more than mere doomsaying and pointless nostalgia.</p>

<p>If it is true that computer scientists &#8220;look to games programming for [their] salvation,&#8221; there is a great opportunity being missed.  There are other options &#8211; exciting, pragmatic, and revolutionary options &#8211; computer scientists might investigate if they believe a wholesale rededication of their skills is needed for the betterment of their field.  (To be sure, some already have begun this great work.)  As a former student of information science and computational linguistics, I&#8217;m here as an interested observer to say that your skills are needed if we are to accomplish some of our loftiest goals.  I humbly submit the following areas that could use your help:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Information retrieval: Build smarter, faster algorithms for finding and organizing information.  Instead of building a better bubble sort, figure out better ways to access and relate disparate bits of information.  The Google guys made a couple bucks at this; why not cite their success, and point at the meteoric rise of Google, as evidence of the continuing and growing sexiness of computer science?</li>
    <li>Semantic web: Bring your knowledge to bear upon the growing semantic web discussion.  If you could think up distributed computing, perhaps the challenge of distributed networks of semantically encoded data is ready for your insight.</li>
    <li>Natural language processing: Be the Google-killer by being the first to market with a usable natural language search tool.  There is much research in NLP, but very little of it seems ready for end-users.  Help make the keyword a thing of the past.  Computational linguists would love to cultivate interdisciplinary connections with you folks.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although McBride&#8217;s article may fade into the background of the very frequent, if strident, cries that CS is dead, I am hopeful that interdisciplinary ties between computer science, information science, library studies, and linguistics will bring about practical innovation, not to mention a renewed sense of relevance and excitement for computer scientists.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great to see academic libraries diving head-first into digital collections / library initiatives, and doing so with dedicated staff.</p>

<p>Some of these positions look like great options for folks like myself who&#8217;ve been bouncing around the digital libraries world for a few years now and are starting to think about taking on greater responsibility within an organization.  I know you&#8217;re out there, folks.  Consider applying!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I followed a series of links[<a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/03/12/will-libraries-smell-like-teen-spirit/#note1">1</a>] to find this <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=b1f851b9-b5ff-41bb-bf17-4aadba0ac89e" target="_blank">article</a> on the effect of Generation X values upon work culture.  The article cites the impending wave of Baby Boomer retirements, pointing out that a number of executive and upper management positions will open up and likely be filled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X">Generation Xers</a>.  Will workplace culture change when GenXers take the reins?  If so, to what extent?  And how will it affect libraries which, unlike the corporate world, are saturnine[<a href="http://www.lackoftalent.org/michael/blog/2007/03/12/will-libraries-smell-like-teen-spirit/#note2">2</a>]?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I usually travel by ground-based transportation &#8211; train when I can, bus when I must &#8211; because I hate flying.  There is something about this sort of travel that makes folks more sociable in my experience.  Frequently a question that I have come to dread is asked: &#8220;So, what do you do?&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google and Princeton University went public twenty minutes ago in announcing their arrangement to digitize roughly one million of Princeton&#8217;s public domain works as part of the ongoing Google Books initiative.  Princeton is one of a growing number of academic institutions in the United States &#8211; including private institutions like Harvard and Stanford and state universities in Virginia, Texas, and California &#8211; that have worked with Google on this.  For more information, see the <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/02/welcoming-princeton-university-to.html" target="_blank">post</a> on the Google Books blog or the official <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/books_princeton.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the details need to be worked out yet, but I am hopeful this will bode well for our users here at Princeton and for the broader community.</p>

<p>The need for digital preservation just grows and grows.</p>
